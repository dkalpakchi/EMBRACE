{"text": "\"A good parent\" can be a confusing phrase. It is almost impossible for one person to be \"a good parent\" at all stages of a child's life.

Then the start of her child's independence might upset and alarm her, and she might then become less helpful for a few years. A father might be awkward and uncomfortable with a younger child, but could turn into an excellent parent when the child is old enough to be taught the skills of cycling, fishing and so on, or to be taken on trips.

{"text": "\"No man is an island\" is a well-known line from John Donne's Devotion. It was written more than three hundred years ago. Even now people still agree with him. No one can live a completely lonely life. Without other people, life will become empty and sad. We all need to have friends.\nFor some of us, although making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move. It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have.\nThere are many books about friendship, but Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, written in 1936, is the most famous. This \"how to\" book about getting along with other people became a best seller. It was later put into 28 languages.\nDale Carnegie's advice seems to be simple, but can his advice help you? Do you need to change the way you act? Here is the list of advice from his book:\nBe friendly and polite.\nAlways greet with a smile. Begin with \"Excuse me\" or \"Would you please\" when you want to ask somebody. Remember to say \"Thank you\" and try to be as helpful as you can.\nGo out of your way to be nice.\nFind some time to do special things for other people. Making some soup for a sick neighbour may seem like a little thing to you, but it will make your neighbor feel a lot better.\nRemember names.\nThey say that the sweetest music to a person's ears is the sound of his or her own name.\nBe open-minded.\nTry to understand other people's ways and ideas and learn something from them.\nListen patiently.\nWhen someone is talking to you, look at him or her, listen carefully and say something when necessary.", "test": [{"id": "12_1", "num": 2603, "mcq": {"stem": "Some of us find it not easy to make friends because   _  .", "choices": ["(A) we are afraid of making bad friends", "(B) we are shy to take the first action", "(C) we feel sure that we already have enough friends", "(D) we feel worried that we won't be able to keep our friends"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other SM", "toi": "4||reason", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "3", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 12, "id": "12_1", "num": 2603, "key": "B", "b_base_s": 284, "b_base_e": 393, "c_base_s": 395, "c_base_e": 460, "d_base_s": 395, "d_base_e": 460, "text_length": 1589}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "For some of us, although making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move", "start": 284, "end": 393}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have", "start": 395, "end": 460}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have", "start": 395, "end": 460}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "For some of us, although making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move.

The main reason for this trip was to spend some time alone to think about the events happening in my life.\nAfter an icy shower, my energies were at their fullest.

If the present rate of smoking continues, the number of deaths each year from smoking could rise to 10 million by the year 2020. \nThe study describes smoking is the biggest cause of deadly diseases among grown-ups in industrial countries. So far most of the smoking deaths have happened to men, especially in developing countries. \nA researcher at the World Health Organization says 70% of Chinese men smoke more than 15 cigarettes each day. In Latin America about 50% of the men are smokers. There also are a very large number of smokers in Russia and in Eastern Europe. And 25% of all smoking deaths worldwide are in those areas of the world. Scientists say smoking will kill 50% of the smokers. \nSmoking is known to cause lung cancer. It also can lead to cancer of the mouth and other parts of bodies. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to suffer from heart disease. \nExperts say that people reduce their chance of dying from smoking if they stop smoking completely.

{"text": "Americans have contributed   to many art forms, and jazz, a type of music, is one of the art forms started in the United States. Black Americans, who sang and played the music of their homeland, created jazz.\nJazz is a mixture of the music of Africa, the work songs the slaves sang, and religious  music. Improvisation   is an important part of jazz. This is why a jazz song sounds a little different each time it is played.\nJazz bands formed in the late 1800s. They played in bars and clubs in many towns and cities of the South, especially New Orleans. New Orleans is an international seaport, and people from all over the world come to New Orleans to hear jazz.\nJazz became more and more popular.

Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives.\nLike Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes the TV talk show to its top.

Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.\nCompared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a \"final word\". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.\nClean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main audience are middle-class Americans.

Disturbed by the problems they create, many head teachers have ordered that pupils should keep their phones switched off at school. Others have told pupils to leave them at home.\nHowever, education researchers at The University of Nottingham believe it is time that phone bans were reassessed, because mobile phones can be a powerful learning aid, they say. Dr Elizabeth Hartnell-Young and her colleagues have reached this conclusion after studying the consequences of allowing pupils in five secondary schools to use either their own mobile phones or the new generation of 'smartphones' in lessons.\nDuring the nine-month experiment, 14- to-16-year-old pupils used the phones for a wide range of educational purposes, including creating short movies, setting homework reminders, recording a teacher reading a poem, and timing experiments with the phones' stopwatches. The smartphones, which could be connected to the Internet, also allowed pupils to access revision websites, log into the school email system, or transfer   electronic files between school and home.\nThe research involved 331 pupils in schools in Cambridgeshire, West Berkshire and Nottingham. \"At the start of the study, even pupils were often surprised at the thought that mobile phones could be used for learning,\" Dr Hartnell-Young said. \"After their hands-on experience, almost all pupils said they had enjoyed the project and felt more inspired.\"\nSome teachers found that pupils who lacked confidence gained most from the project.

{"text": "Do you love Beats headphones, True Religion jeans, and UGG shoes? These are some of the most popular brands   around. They are also expensive. But some experts say they are not much better than cheaper brands.\nFor example, Jim Wilcox works for Consumer Reports. He tested all kinds of headphones. He says that $80 Koss Pro headphones provide basically the same quality   and comfort as Beats. So why do people pay twice or even 10 times as much for the hottest brands?\nExperts say it's because fashionable, expensive brands send a message. Brands say \"I belong\" or \"I can afford it.\"\nSome people think that expensive brand names are worth the price. They say that some designer clothes really are top quality and that they last longer than cheaper brands.

{"text": "From their beginnings New England towns had a special democratic system of government. At a stated time all the citizens would assemble at a town meeting, where they would discuss local problems and express opinions freely. They also elected the town's officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters. These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square.\nIn the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions.

{"text": "Healthy relationships are fun and make you feel good about yourself. The relationships that you make in your teenage years will be a special pan of your life. They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. \n    What makes a relationship healthy?\n    Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n    Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n    How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n    You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n    Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.\n    You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets.

{"text": "I love everything about making Easter dinner except the Saturday shopping. That day, the supermarket can be as crowded as a department store at Christmas. And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.\nTrouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. \"I really don't have anybody else to ask,\" she apologized.\n\"Sure,\" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.\nBy the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.\nI reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought. Then I pulled out a package of sliced turkey, and another of Swiss cheese. That's strange, I thought. There's no way Yola knew my Easter dinner plans. I reached back into the grocery bag, thinking of the Easter miracle. All of a sudden, the strangest feeling came over me. I lifted it out.

{"text": "In 1955, a man named Raymond Kroc entered a partnership with two brothers named Mcdonald. They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" chains  in America and the world.\nWhy was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants.\nSingle parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a \"single lifestyle\" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth.\nFast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day.

People now realize that this unhealthy situation must be changed, and that we must be able to develop in sustainable ways. That means growth with low carbon or development of sustainable products. In other words, we should keep the earth healthy while using its supply of natural resources.\nToday, sustainable development is a proper trend in many countries. According to a recent study, the global market for low-carbon energy will become three times bigger over the next decade. China, for example, has set its mind on leading that market, hoping to seize chances in the new round of the global energy revolution. It is now trying hard to make full use of wind and solar energy, and is spending a huge amount of money making electric cars and high-speed trains. In addition, we are also seeing great growth in the global markets for sustainable products such as palm oil, which is produced without cutting down valuable rainforest. In recent years the markets for sustainable products have grown by more than 50%.\nGovernments can fully develop the potential of these new markets. First, they can set high targets for reducing carbon emissions and targets for saving and reusing energy. Besides, stronger arrangement of public resources like forests can also help to speed up the development. Finally, governments can avoid the huge expenses that are taking us in the wrong direction, and redirecting some of those expenses can accelerate the change from traditional model to a sustainable one.\nThe major challenge of this century is to find ways to meet the needs of growing population within the limits of this single planet.

{"text": "In recent years many countries of the world have been faced with the problem of how to make their workers more productive. Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor.\nOther experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is true. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be used in a fixed way. Thus while freedom of choice may be important, there is usually very little that can be done to create it.\nAnother very important consideration is how each worker contributes to the product he is making. In most factories the worker sees only one part of the product. Some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor, therefore, but it is also one we can do something about.\nTo what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more.

Still, it can never be bad to get exercise, can it?\nTaking all amateur and professional sports in Britain into consideration, there can be no doubt that football is at the top of the list.

It is a kind of football played by two teams of fifteen players rather than eleven. The rugby, in which an oval-shaped ball is used can be handled as well as kicked. It is a pretty rough game.\nIn summer, cricket is the most popular sport. In fact, it has sometimes been called the English national game. Most foreigners find the game rather slow or even boring, but it enjoys great popularity among the British.\nTennis rates high on the list, too. It was introduced into England from France in the 15th century, but it was from England that it spread to practically every country in the world.\nTable-tennis or \"ping-pong\" surely is not played on a great scale as it is in China or in Japan.

He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the backseat. The truck's bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact, but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van.\n\"I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch.\" At the bottom, rocks cut a fuel tank, which caught fire. A tree branch destroyed the windshield and knocked Ronnie unconscious. He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire.\nSteve dashed to Ronnie, who was hanging headfirst from the passenger door. Ronnie had used his pocket knife to cut himself free from the driver's side seat belt only to get his boot trapped in another one. Steve climbed into the burning cab to free him.\nHe tried three times to pull Ronnie out before finally freeing him. But Ronnie's legs were still burning, so Steve laid him on the ground, ripped off his own shirt, and beat the flames with it. He'd managed to drag him about 20 yards when one of the truck's 150 gallon fuel tanks exploded.\nBoth Steve and Ronnie paid a price for risking their lives for strangers. Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts  on both of his legs. Steve suffered smoke breathing and minor burns, and shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke a tooth.\nIn February, the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver.

Below are some tips that will help you live a wonderful life.\n1. Keep a Positive Attitude. Enjoy what you have and work on getting the things you desire. Psychologists believe that optimism   is a good defense against unhappiness, so it is better to keep your optimism alive. Feeling sad about your life will only make you sadder, so be happy.\n2. Don't Be Afraid to Take Risks. Life is all about taking risks, and that's the exciting part of it. Challenges and failure are part of life. Once you learn how to take risks, you'll soon realize how good it feels not to let moments pass you by.\n3. You only have one life, so make it worthwhile. Being unwilling to let the past go just keeps you away from the things you should be enjoying at the present.\n4. List the Things You Want to Do. Stop lazing around and give yourself something to be busy with. Write down a list of all the things you want to do and make a timeline, not to stress you out, but to remind you of your goals. So don't put limits to yourself because you'll never know what may happen.\n5. Try Out Something New. Getting into something or trying something unfamiliar to you may seem scary, but nothing can make you feel happier than being able to overcome your fear. Who knows? You might enjoy it!

{"text": "London Heathrow is the biggest airport in the UK, and it also handles more international passenger traffic than any other airport in the world. For this reason, enlargement was planned and on 27th March a fifth terminal opened to help to deal with the many passengers that pass through the airport. The new terminal has taken a long time to plan and build. The idea was first proposed back in the 1980s. The opening of it has been talked about widely in the media in the UK and expectations were high for the PS4.3 billion project.\n   However, in spite of long preparations at Terminal 5 ahead of the grand opening, things soon went into a mess. There were problems from the very beginning as staff had difficulties finding car parking spaces and getting through security to get into the building. This consequently caused a delay when passengers started to arrive and large numbers of staff were not in place. Long passenger queues formed and the slow start meant that everyone had to play catch-up from the beginning. Staffs were having problems using the new systems and a baggage operator told the BBC, it was all \"shambles   the moment the doors opened\". The terminal has been designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour but due to a reported \"lack of training and essential support that was promised\", a backlog   of luggage soon appeared.\n   By lunchtime on that first day, 20 flights had been cancelled to try to alleviate the problems. Flights continued to be cancelled in the days following the opening and up to 28,000 bags have now had to be placed in temporary storage.

In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble for his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he often ran away from home. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi.

Afterwards, he became a full-time writer.\nIn 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in 1876, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him great fortune.\nUnfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died, and then three of his children passed away.\nAt the age of 70, his hair was completely white. He bought many white suits and neckties.

{"text": "Most young people enjoy some forms of physical activities. It may be walking, cycling or swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some kind, football, hockey, golf, or tennis, it may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountaineering? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no manmade rules, as there are for such game as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind, which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from manmade rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"game\". We would be mistaken in this assumption. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical capacities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his prime by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties.

Unlike everyone else, Nigel wanted to join the contest because he liked making something out of the Lego sets. Nigel spent the next two months rebuilding the robot. It was during the time that Nigel found out about the prizes for the competition as well as another competitor, Alicia, from a neighboring school. His early intentions were forgotten. Getting the thousand-dollar prize was more important than anything else. Nigel decided to befriend Alicia. Unaware of his intentions, she told him all about the robot that she had been building for the competition. He even helped her to put the finishing branches to her robot. He was glad with the way things had progressed. His robot was able to become a ball with its arms, which Alicia had failed to do.\nEverything didn't dawn on her until she saw him among the competition.

{"text": "Recently I have discovered it's often easier for me to do something every day than to do it just some days. I post to my blog six days a week. I take notes every day. I write in my one-sentence journal every day. Many people have told me that they find it easier to exercise when they exercise every day. If I try to do something just four days a week, I spend a lot of time arguing with myself: Is today the day, or is it tomorrow, or the next day? Does the week start on Sunday or Monday?\nIf you do something every day, you tend to fall into a routine. Routine has a bad reputation for lacking excitement. It's true that novelty and challenge bring happiness and that people who break their routines, try new things, and go to new places are happier, but I think that some routine activities also bring happiness. The pleasure of doing the same thing, in the same way, every day, shouldn't be overlooked.

{"text": "Since people first sent rockets into space in the 1950s, we have been leaving behind all sorts of things. Some of them, like the camera, were lost by astronauts while they did work outside their spaceship. But much of the space junk is made up of little pieces of things that were once bigger objects, until they struck each other and broke apart.\nSome things we send into space fall back toward the earth and burn up in the atmosphere. But larger pieces sometimes survive the extreme heat and hit the ground or the ocean at great speeds. So there is always concern that something may fall from the sky and do some harm.\nBut space junk falling on housetops   is not the biggest worry. Scientists are concerned about what happens when an empty rocket strikes another while orbiting   the earth. Two big things become many smaller things. They then hit other things. The pieces get smaller and smaller until they form a cloud of junk that blocks the path of future space vehicles.\nSo what can be done to clean up the space around our planet? Marco Castronuovo, an Italian researcher, talks about sending a satellite into space that would get very close to some of the larger pieces of space junk. The satellite would connect a small rocket to the useless object. When the rocket explodes, it pushes the junk into a lower and slower orbit, nearer the earth. After a time, the junk burns up in the atmosphere.\nMr. Castronuovo has proposed   using a number of small satellites with robotic arms. One arm would catch the space junk, and another arm would connect the rocket. He imagines that each satellite would jump from one large piece of junk to another. He thinks this method could destroy about ten large objects each year.\nScientists have been concerned about space junk for many years. Right now, the costs of the clean-up have been too great. Mr. Castronuovo says his system could be put in place for a much more reasonable amount of money.", "test": [{"id": "731_1", "num": 2492, "mcq": {"stem": "Scientists are most worried that the space junk   _  .", "choices": ["(A) will stop the future space vehicles", "(B) will do harm to the atmosphere", "(C) will fall on the housetops", "(D) will burn up in space"], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other SM", "toi": "4||reason", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 731, "id": "731_1", "num": 2492, "key": "A", "a_base_s": 865, "a_base_e": 978, "b_base_s": 865, "b_base_e": 931, "c_base_s": 625, "c_base_e": 684, "d_base_s": 348, "d_base_e": 437, "text_length": 1943}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "The pieces get smaller and smaller until they form a cloud of junk that blocks the path of future space vehicles.", "start": 865, "end": 978}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "The pieces get smaller and smaller until they form a cloud of junk", "start": 865, "end": 931}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "space junk falling on housetops   is not the biggest worry.", "start": 625, "end": 684}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "Some things we send into space fall back toward the earth and burn up in the atmosphere.

I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news.\nHow did you finally become a weatherman?\nMy first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them.\nBack then, how did you forecast weather?\nIndependent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm.\nHas weather forecasting changed much with new technology?\nAdvanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories.\nAny advice for children who'd like to become weather scientists?\nTo me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can't foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we? Weather forecasting is wide open for scientists who love to solve puzzling problems. The next generation of meteorologists (weather scientists) will unlock many of Earth's weather secrets.

There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table.

French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait.

Their parents don't pick them up the moment they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French kids will sit happily at a restaurant.

Many of its graduates now work in big companies abroad like M.I.T., Caltech and Oxbridge.\nYet the Politechnic has a problem. As you know, here in Italy people speak Italian.

Over 100 teachers went to court to block the plan, referring to a 1933 law that makes Italian the official language.

{"text": "You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. \"If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,\" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.", "test": [{"id": "1033_0", "num": 6, "mcq": {"stem": "Mr. Torres became blind when  _  .", "choices": ["(A) his daughter was just born", "(B) he was thirteen years old", "(C) his mother died of cancer", "(D) his wife was out of work"], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "2||time", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 1033, "id": "1033_0", "num": 6, "key": "A", "a_base_s": 25, "a_base_e": 117, "b_base_s": 118, "b_base_e": 127, "c_base_s": 313, "c_base_e": 338, "d_base_s": 557, "d_base_e": 619, "text_length": 3408}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "Alberto Torres, who is blind.
