{"text": "(Reuters)The Thunderbird is one of the most readily recognized creatures of American Indian mythology.While the vast majority of biologists believe the Thunderbird myth to be nothing more than a spiritual symbol, some zoologists believe that the hard may actually exist.   \nI still vividly recall seeing an impossibly large raptor when I was five years old, which a few people have said might be the Thunderbird.Standing in my grandmother's back yard in Alabama, I recall watching an enormous black bird with a swallow - like tail flying directly over me from an oak tree. Its wingspan seemed to be at least three times my height, which would have made it at least fourteen feet across.\nWhile the early childhood memory is often unreliable, I clearly remember the details of the  \"Thunderbird\".To this very day, I sometimes stand on my grandmother' s yard, eyeballing the old oak tree, but I have not yet seen another bird that resembles the giant bird.I have seen eagles, and hawks - but never another Thunderbird.\nOther modern sightings of what may have been thunderbirds have also occurred.In 1977, three boys were playing in a neighborhood in Illinois.They reported that two large birds chased after  them.One of the boys was attacked and suffered somewhat serious injuries, He was carried a few  feet off the ground, before the bird dropped him and disappeared into the wilderness.\nSeveral people interviewed the boys and their story remained the same, even under the pressure.the description of the birds somewhat matched the Andean condor ; however, these  massive condors have never been known to exist in the United States.\nAnother sighting came in 2002, in Alaska, when many people reported seeing a bird with a fourteen - foot wingspan.After being investigated, it was finally concluded that the bird was most likely a particularly large sea eagle, which typically has a wingspan of six to eight fickle.\nI will probably never know what the strange -looking giant bird from the oak tree was, and biologists will probably never be able to fully confirm the identity of the giant raptors spotted in Illinois and Alaska.If the Thunderbird does indeed exist, it will probably continue to remain mysterious.", "test": [{"id": "25_2", "num": 1348, "mcq": {"stem": "How is the passage mainly organized?", "choices": ["(A) By giving examples.", "(B) By following time order", "(C) By making comparisons.", "(D) By presenting a general idea."], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "GEN", "toi": "4||pattern", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 25, "id": "25_2", "num": 1348, "key": "A", "text_length": 2212}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": null, "c": null, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Another sighting came in 2002, in Alaska, when many people reported seeing a bird with a fourteen - foot wingspan.After being investigated, it was finally concluded that the bird was most likely a particularly large sea eagle, which typically has a wingspan of six to eight fickle.", "start": 1633, "end": 1914}}}], "race_file": "original/RACE/test/high/18655.txt", "id": 25, "flags": {"text_spaces": ["missing spaces (punctuation)", "missing spaces", "extra spaces"], "text_other": ["wrong punctuation (commas instead of periods)."], "text_spelling": ["spelling errors (hyphens)"]}}

{"text": "A recent online poll   asked kids what they hated most about school. \"Classes are boring\" came in first. \"Too much homework\" was a close second. Since all activities remain interesting for only so long, too much homework can lead to ennui. So, why are some kids getting homework overload? Teachers give two reasons. First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities. These parents believe homework is a way to ensure that students are learning as much as possible.\nPeople who favor homework argue that it can have many beneficial effects. They claim it can help students develop good study habits. Homework can help students recognize that learning can occur at home as well as at school. It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .\nBut studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills. For example, sports teams teach cooperation and leadership, in addition to helping kids stay physically active. Another problem with too much homework is that parents can get too involved.

{"text": "After the first World War, a small group of veterans   returned to their village in Britain. Most of them managed to get along fairly well, but one--Francis Blustering, who had been wounded and who never recovered his strength-- was unable to work like others. In time he became very poor. Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. \nOnce, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.\nOne of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \"You refuse, then?\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \"Yes, I cannot allow it.\"\nOne by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.\nA few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \n\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\"", "test": [{"id": "93_3", "num": 2315, "mcq": {"stem": "What can we learn from the story?", "choices": ["(A) Think twice before you make a judgment.", "(B) Blustering is a poor father and husband.", "(C) Blustering would rather live alone than be considered a thief.", "(D) Blustering is an example we should learn from."], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "GEN", "toi": "4||theme", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 93, "id": "93_3", "num": 2315, "key": "A", "b_base_s": 1457, "b_base_e": 1607, "c_base_s": 1405, "c_base_e": 1454, "text_length": 1607}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\"", "start": 1457, "end": 1607}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly", "start": 1405, "end": 1454}, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": "inconsistency between alternatives", "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.", "start": 1356, "end": 1606}}}], "race_file": "original/RACE/test/high/24212.txt", "id": 93, "flags": {"text_spaces": ["missing spaces (punctuation)", "missing spaces"]}}

{"text": "Attitude is an internal  state that influences the choices of personal action made by the individual . Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states. Here, we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior, that is, upon the choices of action made by the individual.\nThe kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes. Whether one listens to classical music or rock, whether one obeys the speed limit while driving, whether one encourages one's husband or wife to express his or her own ideas-all are influenced by attitudes. These internal states are acquired  throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home, in the streets, and in the school.\nOf course, the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation. An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight. A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice. But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time, and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations, is what is meant by an attitude.\nAttitudes are learned in a variety of ways. They can result from single events, as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake. They can result from the individual's experiences of success and pleasure, as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them. And frequently, they are learned by copying other people's behavior, as when a child learns how to behave toward foreigners by observing the actions of his parents.

{"text": "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it.", "test": [{"id": "156_3", "num": 3016, "mcq": {"stem": "We can infer from the passage that   _  .", "choices": ["(A) about 50% of first marriages end in divorce in the U.S, much higher than other parts of the world", "(B) never tie the knot before you make sure he or she will not divorce you", "(C) it usually takes 7-10 years to rebuild one's credit if it is broken for any reason", "(D) it's unusual for people in their 20's to have money these days"], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other SM", "toi": "3||assertion", "pod": "inference", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 156, "id": "156_3", "num": 3016, "key": "C", "a_base_s": 2220, "a_base_e": 2273, "b_base_s": 2117, "b_base_e": 2219, "c_base_s": 2525, "c_base_e": 2654, "d_base_s": 3757, "d_base_e": 3858, "text_length": 4192}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.", "start": 2220, "end": 2273}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "Hopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot,", "start": 2117, "end": 2219}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "It can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy.", "start": 2525, "end": 2654}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days.", "start": 3757, "end": 3858}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": "inconsistency between alternatives", "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": ["(b) represents a piece of advice / a recommendation to follow, while other alternatives provide a fact from the text"], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "It can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy.

{"text": "Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.\nOn January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.\nIn times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken.

{"text": "History is full of cases where dreams have been a pathway to creativity and discovery. A striking example is provided by Dr. Otto Loewi, a pharmacologist and winner of a Nobel Prize. Loewi had spent years studying the chemical transmission  of nerve impulses  . A major breakthrough in his research came when he dreamed of an experiment three nights in a row. On the first two nights he woke up and wrote down the experiment quickly and untidily on paper. But the next morning, he couldn't tell what the notes meant. On the third night, he got up after having the dream. This time, instead of making notes he went straight to his laboratory and performed the important experiment. Loewi later said that if the experiment had occurred to him while awake he would not have given it another thought.\nLoewi's experiment gives some insight into using dreams to produce creative solutions. Nervous feelings are reduced during dreaming, which may be especially useful in solving problems that require a fresh point of view.\n Being able to take advantage of dreams for solving is improved if you \"set\" yourself before sleeping. Before you go to bed, try to think intently about a problem you wish to solve. Bury yourself in the problem by stating it clearly and reviewing all relevant information. Then use the suggestions listed in the previous section to catch your dreams. Although this method is not guaranteed to produce an original solution or a new insight, it is certain to be an adventure. About half of a group of college students using the method for a week recalled a dream that helped them solve a personal problem.www.ks5u.com", "test": [{"id": "358_0", "num": 1098, "mcq": {"stem": "Through Loewi's experiment, the author tries to prove that   _  .", "choices": ["(A) very little is really known about the meaning of dreams", "(B) dreams can be useful in producing creative solutions to one's problems", "(C) it is possible to \"catch\" one's dreams by planning before going to sleep", "(D) it helped in the study of transmission of nerve impulses"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both SM", "toi": "4||evidence", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 358, "id": "358_0", "num": 1098, "key": "B", "b_base_s": 797, "b_base_e": 883, "c_base_s": 1018, "c_base_e": 1120, "text_length": 1632}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "Loewi's experiment gives some insight into using dreams to produce creative solutions.", "start": 797, "end": 883}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "Being able to take advantage of dreams for solving is improved if you \"set\" yourself before sleeping.

{"text": "Jogging has become the most popular individual sport in America. Many theories,even some mystical ones,have been advanced to explain the popularity of jogging. The plain truth is that jogging is a cheap,quick and efficient way to maintain (or achieve) physical fitness.\nThe most useful sort of exercise is exercise that develops the heart,lungs, and circulatory systems. If these systems are fit,the body is ready for almost any sport and for almost any sudden demand made by work or emergencies. One can train more specifically,as by developing strength for weight lifting or the ability to run straight ahead for short distances with great power as in football,but running trains your heart and lungs to deliver oxygen more efficiently to all parts of your body. It is worth doing that: this sort of exercise is the only kind that can reduce heart disease, the number one cause of death in America.\nOnly one sort of equipment is needed--a pair of good shoes. Physicians advise beginning joggers not to try to run in tennis or gym shoes. Many design advances have been made in only the last several years that make a pair of excellent running shoes indispensable if a runner wishes to develop as quickly as possible,with as little chance of injury as possible. A pair of good running shoes will have soft pads for absorbing shock, as well as slightly built-up heels and full heel cups that will give the knee and ankle more stability.

{"text": "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom.

{"text": "Many adults in the United States can remember crying the nursery rhyme in the street \"Hot cross buns!\" But only a few people realize this was an early form of advertising.\nWritten advertisements probably began with hieroglyphics more than three thousand years ago, but only a few people could read these symbols. So merchants made signs with pictures or hung their tools over their doors to identify their businesses.\nIn the time of the Roman Empire, wall paintings were a popular form of advertisement. An ad for a play, or some other performance was painted on part of a building or on a wall around a city. People often advertised a house for rent or a freshwater bath in this way, too.\nToday, large wall signs are still used for outdoor advertising. But outdoor advertising is only a small fraction of the total advertising. About forty per -cent of all ads are printed in daily newspapers. Radio commercials also provide this kind of information. Some people think they are the best form of advertising because radio broadcasts reach almost everyone in a nation.\nAdvertisements in magazines and on television reach many people, too.

The study's lead author, Erica Kenney, at first planned to look into the amount of sugary drinks kids were drinking in schools. However, during her research she found that many kids were simply not drinking enough water.\nKenney and her team examined data from a group of 4,000 children, aged 6 to19, between the years of 2009 and 2012. The data was taken from the National Health and Nutrition Survey,a study on the health of children in the United States conducted each year by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention..\nWhile looking through the survey results, she noticed that more than half of the kids who took part in the study were dehydrated  . Of' that group, boys were 76% more likely than girls not to have enough water in their system. Nearly one quarter of the kids in the survey reported drinking no plain water at all.\n\"These findings highlight  a possible health issue that wasn't given a lot of attention in the past,\" Kenney said in a statement. \"Even though for most of these kids this is not an immediate and great health threat, this is an issue that could really be reducing quality of life and well-being for many children and youth.\"\nThe United States-National Agriculture Library says average kids need between 10 to 14 cups of water every day.

Afterwards, he became a full-time writer.\nIn 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in 1876, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him great fortune.\nUnfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died, and then three of his children passed away.\nAt the age of 70, his hair was completely white. He bought many white suits and neckties.

{"text": "Most people who live in Seattle, Washington, love their city. There is a never-ending flow of fun things to do. But, people who live there do not always enjoy the day-after-day absence of sunshine during the winter months.\nIt is documented fact that sunshine (or lack of it) plays a major role in how each of us meets the day. It also affects how we perform at school or work. When people are derived of sunlight, they can develop seasonal affective disorder, which makes it difficult for them to feel happy or get things accomplished. No major city in the United States is more affected by the \"sunshine factor\" than Seattle.\nTo fight drizzle and fog during the winter months, Steve Murphy created a business that is very popular among the locals. The Indoor Sun Shoppe is more than a little ray of sunshine during the gray days of Seattle's winter. His shop offers a huge source of plants and artificial lighting for people who are trying to overcome seasonal affective disorder.\nLocated in Fremont, Washington, The Indoor Sun Shoppe has an amazing collection of exotic plants and \"good bugs\" in a humid and well-lit environment. At The Indoor Sun Shoppe, you can spend up to $400 for artificial lighting that will chase away the winter blues. It will also keep your plants healthy.

to.We would stick to the freeways and arrive tired.\nBut then Banner,our lamb was born.He was rejected by his mama days before our planned trip to Boise.I had two choices:leave Banner with my husband,or take him with me.My husband made the decision for me.\nThat is how I found myself on the road with four kids,a baby lamb and nothing but my everlasting optimism to see me through.We took the country roads out of necessity.We had to stop every hour,let Banner shake out his legs and feed him.The kids chased him and one another.They'd get back in the car breathless and energized,smelling fresh from the cold air.\nWe explored side roads,catching grasshoppers in waisthigh grass.Even if we simply looked out of the car windows at baby pigs following their mother,or fish leaping out of the water,it was better than the best ride down the freeway.Here was life.And new horizons  .\nWe eventually arrived at my parents' doorstep astonishingly fresh and full of stories.\nI grew brave with the trip back home and creative with my disciplining technique.On an empty section of road,everyone started quarreling.I stopped the car,ordered all kids out and told them to meet me up ahead.I parked my car half a mile away and read my book in sweet silence.\nSome road trips are by necessity fast and straight.But that trip with Banner opened our eyes to a world available to anyone adventurous enough to wander around and made me realize that a detour may uncover the best part of a journey-and the best part of yourself.", "test": [{"id": "686_1", "num": 2833, "mcq": {"stem": "The author stopped

{"text": "Researchers in the psychology department at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have discovered a major difference in the way men and women respond to stress. This difference may explain why men are more likely to suffer from stress-related disorders.\nUntil now, psychological research has maintained that both men and women have the same \"fight-or-flight\" reaction to stress. In other words, individuals either react with aggressive behavior, such as verbal or physical conflict (\"fight\"), or they react by withdrawing from the stressful situation (\"flight\"). However, the UCLA research team found that men and women have quite different biological and behavioral responses to stress. While men often react to stress in the fight-or-flight response, women often have another kind of reaction which could be called \"tend and befriend.\" That is, they often react to stressful conditions by protecting and nurturing their young (\"tend\"), and by looking for social contact and support from others - especially other females ('befriend\").\nScientists have long known that in the fight-or- flight reaction to stress, an important role is played by certain hormones  released by the body. The UCLA research team suggests that the female tend-or-befriend response is also based on a hormone. This hormone, called oxytocin, has been studied in the context of childbirth, but now it is being studied for its role in the response of both men and women to stress. The principal investigator, Dr. Shelley E. Taylor, explained that \"animals and people with high levels of oxytocin are calmer, more relaxed, more  social, and less anxious.\" While men also secrete oxytocin, its effects are reduced by male hormones.\nIn terms of everyday behavior, the UCLA study found that women are far more likely than men to seek social contact when they are feeling stressed. They may phone relatives or friends, or ask directions if they are lost.\nThe study also showed how fathers and mothers responded differently when they came home to their family after a stressful day at work. The typical father wanted to be left alone to enjoy some peace and quiet. For a typical mother, coping with a bad day at work meant focusing her attention on her children and their needs.\nThe differences in responding to stress may explain the fact that women have lower frequency of stress-related disorders such as high blood pressure or aggressive behavior. The tend-and-befriend regulatory  system may protect women against stress, and this may explain why women on average live longer than men.", "test": [{"id": "700_0", "num": 2948, "mcq": {"stem": "The UCLA study shows that in response to stress, men are more likely than women to   _   .", "choices": ["(A) turn to friends for help", "(B) solve a conflict calmly", "(C) find an escape from reality", "(D) seek comfort from children"], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "2||action", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "3", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 700, "id": "700_0", "num": 2948, "key": "C", "a_base_s": 1863, "a_base_e": 1898, "c_base_s": 2071, "c_base_e": 2143, "d_base_s": 2144, "d_base_e": 2258, "text_length": 2570}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "They may phone relatives or friends", "start": 1863, "end": 1898}, "b": null, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "The typical father wanted to be left alone to enjoy some peace and quiet", "start": 2071, "end": 2143}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": " For a typical mother, coping with a bad day at work meant focusing her attention on her children and their needs.", "start": 2144, "end": 2258}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "In terms of everyday behavior, the UCLA study found that women are far more likely than men to seek social contact when they are feeling stressed.

{"text": "Scholarship Application Tips in 2014 for college students\nBefore you apply\n1. Work hard to get good grades. Don't sweat about one bad grade, but always strive to do your best.\n2. Get involved, and stay involved, in extracurricular activities. Sports, clubs, drama, bands and orchestras-these often count toward a student's overall scholarship application evaluation. The same goes for paid (or unpaid) work experience.\n3. Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible. Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring.\n4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.\nDuring the application process\n1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind.\n2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic.\n3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility.\n4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off.\n5. Don't wait until the last minute to complete your application, especially if you are applying online. Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline.\n6. If a third party has to complete part of your application, such as providing a letter of recommendation, make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials.\n7. Last but not least, review your application with your parents to make sure you haven't left out any important details.\nGood luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs!", "test": [{"id": "706_0", "num": 3027, "mcq": {"stem": "Before you apply for a scholarship, it's best to  _  .", "choices": ["(A) pay more attention to grades than to extracurricular activities", "(B) focus on only one scholarship application", "(C) get as much work experience as possible", "(D) begin your preparation as early as possible"], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "3||alternative", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "2", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "items": "1", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 706, "id": "706_0", "num": 3027, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 145, "a_base_e": 175, "b_base_s": 619, "b_base_e": 732, "c_base_s": 78, "c_base_e": 87, "d_base_s": 422, "d_base_e": 521, "text_length": 2083}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "always strive to do your best.", "start": 145, "end": 175}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.", "start": 619, "end": 732}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "Work hard", "start": 78, "end": 87}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible.", "start": 422, "end": 521}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": "instructory texts with lists"}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Before you apply\n1.

The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.\n              The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\" and \"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\" The same questions were asked about fathers.\n              People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers.

The announcement came as Morrisons posted a 13% increase in underlying pre-tax profits of PS869 million in the year to January 30.\nMorrisons is implementing a growth strategy which is focused on expanding its e-commerce business and moving into the convenience store market. It has earmarked PS3 billion in investment over the next three years. The supermarket floated the idea of launching its own website last year and today is the first firm commitment to realising that goal.\nLast month, the company took its first major step to launching an online operation with the acquisition of internet retailer Kiddicare for PS70 million. The company said this move, along with the 10% \"strategic\" stake in American online grocer FreshDirect announced today, would help it launch its own website in the future. FreshDirect was launched in 2002 and serves 600,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The deal will see Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips join the company's board.\nMorrisons also revealed it would open three convenience stores, around 3,000 sq ft in size, in July under the name M Local. The shops will be located in Morrisons' heartland in the north of England, in neighbourhoods around the M62 motorway. The company said the convenience business was the second-fastest growing part of the market.

As one of the traditional ways to celebrate Tomb-sweeping Day - burning paper or incense - isn't exactly good for air quality.\nIn contrast to the sadness of the tomb sweepers, people also enjoy hope of Spring on this day. The Qingming Festival is a time when the sun shines brightly, the trees and grass become green and nature is again lively. Since ancient times, people have followed the custom of Spring outings.

{"text": "The Haitian tsunami gave scientists a chance to find out how well vital and potentially life-saving warning systems were working.\nNoaa's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory has developed a warning system that picks up signals of tsunamis directly from the sea-floor.\nIt is called Dart-the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis. If seismometers  detect an earthquake, the Dart buoys  will determine what is happening to sea levels, and whether a big wave might be on the way. This information is then sent via satellite to a central location which can organize an alarm. Within 50 minutes of the Haiti earthquake, this system was able to issue an alarm to other countries in the Caribbean to say that a small tsunami had been caused to start, and that was unlikely to affect them.\nDr Bernard said, \"The first 30 minutes following the earthquake, we have to rely on education.\" The critical aspects of this are: do you feel the earthquake; do you see the ocean draw down; and do you hear that loud roar? If so, you should run for higher ground.\n\"But after the first few minutes, it's crucial that we have the technology--the measurements to avoid unnecessary evacuation and tell people when it is safe to return.\" Right now, there are 50 of these Dart buoys all over the globe--four of which are in the Caribbean.\nDr Bernard says that, with 75 to 100 buoys worldwide, this system could provide global tsunami warnings within one hour.\n\"That's for everywhere we know that tsunamis have happened. If we wanted to go to half an hour detection, we could probably double or multiply by four times that number,\" he said.\n\"In some countries, including Haiti, there may not be enough resources to support a specific tsunami warning centre for something that happens so infrequently.\"\nHe said that this system was relatively inexpensive to fix and operate.\n\"To get it down to an hour for everywhere affected would cost $50m initial investment and then 10% of that to maintain it,\" he said.\n\"That's not a terribly expensive system considering the potential savings of lives.\"", "test": [{"id": "786_0", "num": 242, "mcq": {"stem": "In which section would you probably read the passage in a newspaper?", "choices": ["(A) Education and Society", "(B) Culture and Leisure", "(C) Science and Technology", "(D) Health and Medicine"], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "2||type/kind", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 786, "id": "786_0", "num": 242, "key": "C", "text_length": 2077}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": null, "c": null, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": ["for such questions, usually two or more paragraphs are required, though in this particular case, an advanced reader can make a conclusion from the vocabulary used in the first paragraph."], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "The Haitian tsunami gave scientists a chance to find out how well vital and potentially life-saving warning systems were working.", "start": 0, "end": 129}}}, {"id": "786_2", "num": 244, "mcq": {"stem": "Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?", "choices": ["(A) The system can warn people of the coming of tsunami directly after the earthquake.", "(B) We can't escape the danger of tsunami within 30 minutes following the earthquake.", "(C) Each country can easily afford a tsunami warning centre though it seldom happens.", "(D) It's worthwhile to spend money on the warning system for possible savings of lives."], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "3||assertion", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 786, "id": "786_2", "num": 244, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 359, "a_base_e": 488, "b_base_s": 812, "b_base_e": 888, "c_base_s": 1788, "c_base_e": 1859, "d_base_s": 1993, "d_base_e": 2077, "text_length": 2077}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "detect an earthquake, the Dart buoys  will determine what is happening to sea levels, and whether a big wave might be on the way.", "start": 359, "end": 488}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "The first 30 minutes following the earthquake, we have to rely on education.", "start": 812, "end": 888}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "He said that this system was relatively inexpensive to fix and operate.", "start": 1788, "end": 1859}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "\"That's not a terribly expensive system considering the potential savings of lives.\"", "start": 1993, "end": 2077}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "\"That's not a terribly expensive system considering the potential savings of lives.\"", "start": 1993, "end": 2077}}}], "race_file": "original/RACE/test/high/11572.txt", "id": 786, "flags": {"text_spaces": ["missing spaces (punctuation)"], "text_spelling": ["spelling errors (hyphens)"], "str": ["\"it is called dart-the deep-ocean assessment [...]\"\nwrong symbols?"]}}

{"text": "Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly. He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets --nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said \"Ding-Dong-Dong\", \"Ding-Dong-Dong\" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped.\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello! I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\"\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.\nBen said, \"Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?\"\nTom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing.\"\n\"Say --I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work -- wouldn't you? Of course you would.\"\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said \"What do you call work?\"\n\"Why, isn't that work?\"\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?\"\nThe brush continued to move.\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,\n\"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\"\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.\n\"No --no --it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.\"\n\"No --is that so? Oh come, now --let me just try. Only just a little.\" \"Ben, I'd like to, but if it isn't done right, I'm afraid Aunt Polly ... \"\n\"Oh, I'll be careful. Now let me try. Say --I'll give you the core of my apple.\"\n\"Well, here --No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid ...\"\n\"I'll give you all of it.\"\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat --and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures.\nAnd he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company -and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends.\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get.", "test": [{"id": "903_0", "num": 262, "mcq": {"stem": "How many characters are mentioned in this story?", "choices": ["(A) 7", "(B) 6", "(C) 5", "(D) 4"], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "2||amount", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "toc": "addition (+)", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 903, "id": "903_0", "num": 262, "key": "C", "a_base_s": 2281, "a_base_e": 2291, "c_base_s": 3719, "c_base_e": 3726, "text_length": 4244}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "Tom Sawyer", "start": 2281, "end": 2291}, "b": null, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "Johnny ", "start": 3719, "end": 3726}, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Tom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart.

But what almost no one outside the world of Wal-Mart and none of its 21,000 suppliers know is the high cost of those low prices.

{"text": "When Carlos Westez died at the age of 76, a language died, too. Westez, more commonly known as Red Thunder Cloud, was the last speaker of the Native American language, Catawba.www.ks5u.com\nAnyone who wants to hear various songs of the Catawba tribe   can get in touch with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where, back in the 1940s, Red Thunder Cloud recorded a series of songs for future generations. They are all that is left of the Catawba language. The language that people used to speak is gone forever.\nWe are all aware of the damage that modern industry can do to the world's ecology. However, few people are aware of the effect that widely spoken languages have on other languages and ways of life. English has spread all over the world. Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and Hindi have become powerful languages, as well. As these languages become more powerful, their use as tools of business and culture increases. When this happens, hundreds of languages that are spoken by only a few people die out.\nScholars believe there are about 6,000 languages around the world, but more than half of them could die out within the next 100 years. Araki is a native language of the island of Vanuatu, located in the Pacific Ocean. It is spoken by only a few older adults, so like Catawba, Araki will soon disappear. Many languages of Ethiopia will have the same fate because each one has only a few speakers. In the Americas,100 languages also are dying out.\nRed Thunder Cloud was one of the first to recognize the threat of language death and to try to do something about it. He was not actually born into the Catawba tribe, and the language was not his mother tongue.

At the end of last term, I packed a large bag and a small bag and set off for London, where I was planning to catch the Eurostar train to Paris. Minutes after getting off the train at Kings Cross Station, I realized that I'd left the small bag in the overhead luggage rack. I ran back to the train, but it had already left the platform.\n   This all happened several months ago, and I had become resigned to the loss of my most precious possession.

The photo of my great grandparents was on Bay !\n   I called the person who was advertising it. He was a little suspicious at first, and told me that he had bought it from a stall at an antique market. After we talked for a while, he asked if there was any way I could prove it was mine. All I could think of was that the photo was taken in March 1939.

Fan Zhongyan, a great artist and poet, was invited to write the well-known poem about Yueyang Tower. In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower (<<>> ), Fan writes: \"Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land, the last to enjoy universal happiness.\" His words have been well-known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before.\nThe style of Yueyang Tower is quite special. The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories, flying eave   and wood construction, the helmet-roof of such a large size is a rarity   among the ancient architectures in China.\nEntering the tower, you'll see \"Dongting is the water of the world, Yueyang is the tower of the world\". Moving on, there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three-Kingdom Period general Lu Su. To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion  in honor of Du Fu. Stepping out of the Xiaoxiang Door, the Xianmei Pavilion and the Sanzui Pavilion can be seen standing on two sides.
