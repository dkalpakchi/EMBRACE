{"text": "\"Hitler and the Germans,\" an exhibition in Berlin's German Historical Museum which aims to investigate the society that created Hitler, has seen more than 10,000 visitors walk through its doors since opening on Friday.\nRudolf Trabold, a spokesman for the museum, said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone. People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in. Ravi Nair, a 73-year-old Indian visitor, said: \"I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it.

Some animals have the same code.\"\n     Scientists recently discovered that animals that live in groups, such as elephants, foxes, and wolves, are especially likely to follow rules. If they don't, and each does its own thing, the group might break apart. Group members would be forced to live alone. Then they'd have a harder time hunting and raising their young.\n    That's probably why a traveling wolf pack stopped and waited to let its slowly moving leader catch up. Similar social ties may have caused a captive elephant to save her friend from drowning. Selfish reasons certainly motivated the male fox, who wanted to keep playing.\nSometimes, though, animals go out of their way to do what's right, even when there's nothing in it for them. Nobody knows why. \" It might simply feel good to be kind, just as it does for humans,\"  says Bekoff.\n     If your friend wasn't nice to you, what would you do? Maybe you would just walk away. That's exactly what a wild red fox did when she was play-boxing with another fox. The larger fox, a male, began pushing too hard. The little female didn't like fighting. She ran away quickly.\n     \" He still wanted to play,\" says Marc Bekoff. So the male fox ran after his playmate, bowed down, and rolled over.

{"text": "\"Migrant workers\"  is a familiar term for 17-year-old Shi Jian. Her father and uncle often talk about the problems surrounding this group of people. However, Shi cares more about the children of these migrant workers.\nLast year Shi's housekeeper's daughter had to give up her schooling in Beijing because she would not be allowed to sit the national college entrance exam. She was forced to continue her high school education in her hometown in Sichuan Province.\nShi thinks the current law is unfair for migrant workers' children, as it prevents them from studying at public schools, unless their parents pay huge sums. So, Shi decided to do a survey of migrant workers so that she could find some solutions to help solve the problem.\nIn the last six months Shi spoke to 186 migrant workers in Beijing. Her interviewees include babysitters, guards, keepers, supermarket clerks, house cleaners and construction site workers. Shi found out that 55 of them were parents. Among this group, only eight have children who attend schools in Beijing. The other 47 had to leave children with relatives in the countryside. However, 40 of the 47 would like to enroll  their children in city schools.\nFrom her interviews, Shi found that the workers' lowest income was 400 yuan each month. Over one-third earn a monthly wage of or below 1000 yuan. \"Even schools for migrant workers' children charge more than public schools. Morever, parents constantly worry about these schools closing or relocating,\" she explained.\nShi has recently completed a report about her survey, in which she makes a series of recommendations. \"The government can set up public schools for migrants' children equal to schools for city children.

{"text": "\"To be or not to be.\" Outside the Bible, these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly, or to live dully and meanly. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: \"I think, therefore I am.\"\nBut the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: \"To be is to be in relations.\" If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity  of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But other than our regular occupation, how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned --- poetry and prose , music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, international affairs ---you are dead.\nOn the contrary, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest --- even more, a new accomplishment  --- you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in different kinds of subjects can remain unhappy. The real _ is the person who has lost interest.\nBacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts with new friends, and new ideas and thoughts, too. Where your thoughts are, there will be your life too. If your thoughts are limited only to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to your narrow circle of the town in which you live, then you live a narrow restricted(, ) life. But if you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living in China. If you're interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people. If you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.\nTo be or not to be --- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, which depends on ourselves.

{"text": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.", "test": [{"id": "22_0", "num": 810, "mcq": {"stem": "When he was asked about the most important thing he had done in life at a presentation, the author    _   .", "choices": ["(A) felt it was not an interesting question", "(B) thought for a while and spoke his mind", "(C) gave an answer from a lawyer's point of view", "(D) didn't give the real answer"], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "2||action", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "3", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 22, "id": "22_0", "num": 810, "key": "D", "b_base_s": 140, "b_base_e": 177, "c_base_s": 239, "c_base_e": 351, "d_base_s": 140, "d_base_e": 202, "text_length": 4164}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "The answer came to me in an instant.

{"text": "A person named Bernard Jackson today is a free man, but he has many bitter memories. He spent five years in prison after a jury  wrongly convicted (...) him of raping two women. At Jackson's trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them in another location at the time of the crime, he was convicted  anyway. Why? The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified Jackson as the man who had attacked them. The court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the real criminal.\nMany factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a group of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs of similar faces. The number of people in the group, and whether it is a person or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them.\nMany people believe that police officers are more reliable than ordinary people. Psychologists decided to test this idea, and they discovered that it is not true. Two psychologists showed a film of crimes to both police officers and civilians. The psychologists found no difference between the police and the civilians in correctly remembering the details of the crimes.\nDespite all the possibilities for inaccuracy, courts cannot omit eyewitness testimony from a trial. American courts depend almost completely on eyewitness testimony to resolve court cases. Sometimes it is the only evidence to a crime, such as rape. Furthermore, eyewitness testimony is often correct. Although people do sometimes make mistakes, and convict innocent people, more importantly, eyewitness testimony has rightly convicted a larger number of guilty people.\nAmerican courts depend on the ability of the twelve jurors, and not the judges, to determine the accuracy of the witness's testimony.

His victim, who picked up the ticket, then claimed the PS25000 prize, managed to trace him, and handed over the cash.

{"text": "Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why they're always getting criticism. Their critics seem to resent(...) them because they have a gift for self-promotion and because they have so much money to throw around. 'It's unjust,' they say, 'that this entirely unproductive industry (if we can call it that) should absorb millions of pounds each year. It only goes to show how much profit the big companies are making. Why don't they stop advertising and reduce the price of their goods? After all, it's the consumer who pays...'\nThe poor old consumer! He'd have to pay a great deal more if advertising didn't create mass markets for products. It is precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so cheap. But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods. Another equally important function is to inform. A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read. Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about. Supposing you wanted to buy a washing machine, it is more than likely you would obtain details regarding performance, price, etc., from an advertisement.\nLots of people pretend that they never read advertisements, but this claim may be seriously doubted. It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days. And what fun they often are, too! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements. Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading railway byelaws  while waiting for a train? Would you like to read only closely printed columns of news in your daily paper? A cheerful, witty advertisement makes such a difference to a dull wall or a newspaper full of the daily ration  of disasters.\nWe must not forget, either, that advertising makes a positive contribution to our pockets. Newspapers, commercial radio and television companies could not survive without this source of revenue . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers. Just think what a newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full price!\nAnother thing we mustn't forget is the 'small ads.' which are in virtually every newspaper and magazine.  What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community! Just about anything can be accomplished through these columns. For instance, you can find a job, buy or sell a house, announce a birth, marriage or death in what used to be called the 'hatch(giving birth), match and dispatch' column but by far the most fascinating section is the personal or 'agony' column . No other item in a newspaper provides such entertaining reading or offers such a deep insight into human nature.

He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers. \n\"All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,\" he wrote in his blog post.\nDavid's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent. \n\"Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, \"Mr McClellan told the local ABC News. \nAt MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering.

Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. \n     When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools. \nDavid's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. \"I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

{"text": "Are you addicted to computer games? Do you stay up all night playing them? Do you feel happy after you play computer games?\nThere's no doubt that the excitement and appealing of games these days makes them hard to put down. We are attracted by the choice when it comes to gaming: You can role play--creating your own fantasy characters and stories, giving you a chance to step out of everyday life into an imaginary world. And there are shooting games where you can let out your anger and depression in violent situations where you kill people with guns. You can get excited from the games.\nHowever, can these kinds of games really be fun and can being absorbed in virtual reality be good for us? Should we worry about their effects on our health? Popular games like Grand Theft Auto have been blamed for everything from falling results at school to causing acts of extreme violence. Internet safety adviser, Alan MacKenzie, thinks \"any people understandably will just think that a game is just a game and not realizing the exact content that's in there\". He gives an example of the violence, which he says is \"wholly inappropriate for anybody, not to mention children.\"\nOthers will argue that gaming is a harmless form of entertainment. There is evidence that playing video games could actually be good for us. Some games like Game of Thrones and World of Warcraft are educational and using games certainly can help children learn good qualities. Studies have also shown that the skills used in playing games can cause growth in certain areas of the brain, the ability to think in 3D and even improve our eyesight.\nVideo game players are also no longer just simple creatures. For some, gaming is having a positive effect on their social lives with games like Halo and World of Warcraft often being played in groups. When your group works together to win the game, your sense of achievement is higher than when winning by yourself.\nSo every coin has two sides. It seems today, gaming isn't just for game fans and if used in a proper way, we can all take part. If video games have two sides, what side do you stand by?", "test": [{"id": "127_0", "num": 660, "mcq": {"stem": "The writer used a lot of questions at the beginning to   _  .", "choices": ["(A) show his worries about the effect on health", "(B) lead into the topic of the passage", "(C) ask the reader for their own opinions about games", "(D) doubt the advantage of playing computer games"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "3||purpose", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 127, "id": "127_0", "num": 660, "key": "B", "text_length": 2117}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": null, "c": null, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "So every coin has two sides.

{"text": "Are you having too much salt? You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.\nWhat problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.\nSalt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride  . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.\nBut past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.\nIf you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do. Here are some tips:\nCut back on high salt foods.\nMost foods contain some salt. But some foods such as cheese, bacon, pickles  , smoked fish and chips are almost always high in salt because of the way they are made. You can still enjoy them, but try to have these in smaller amounts, or eat them less often.\nChoose reduced salt bread and breakfast cereals.\nBread and breakfast cereals   are major source of salt in the diet, not that they're necessarily high in salt but because we eat a lot of them. For these foods, there can be a really big difference between different types and brands. So next time you're shopping, take the time to compare the salt levels on a few similar products. And always try to choose the ones lower in salt.\n*Avoid adding salt to cooking and at table.

{"text": "As people have accurately observed,smiles are absent from early photographs. In 1852,for instance,a girl sat for her Daguerrotype,her head slightly turned,giving the camera an unsmiling look. She is preserved forever as a very serious girl indeed. Charles Darwin,a loving and playful parent,looks frozen in photographs. Why did our ancestors,from unknown sitters for family portraits  to the great and famous,because so sad in front of the camera?\nThe severity is everywhere in Victorian photographs. However,you don't have to look very long at these unsmiling old photos to see how incomplete the seemingly obvious answer is-that they are freezing their faces in order to keep still for the long exposure times. In Julia Margaret Cameron's Portrait of Tennyson,the poet dreams,his face a shadowed mask of genius. This is not simply a technique. It's an emotional choice.\nPeople in the past did not go around in a continual state of sorrow. In fact,the Victorians had a sense of humor even about the darkest aspects of their society. Laughter was not just common in the past but accepted by society far more than it is today,from medieval carnivals  to Georgian print shops,where people gathered to look at the latest funnies. Far from preventing festivals and fun,the Victorians,who invented photography,also created Christmas as a celebration as it is today. So the severity of people in the 19th-century photographs cannot be the evidence of generalized sadness. This was not a society in permanent desperation. Instead,the true answer has to do with attitudes to portraiture itself.\nPeople who sat for early photographs understood it as a significant moment. Sitting for the camera was cheaper,quicker and meant that people who never had a chance to be painted could now be photographed; but people seemed to have taken it seriously in the same way they would be a painted portrait. Like a portrait painting,it was intended as a timeless record of a person.\nTo me those unsmiling people probably had as much fun as we do,if not more.

It consists of sending or posting cruel messages, photos, or videos on the Internet or other electronic media with the intent of damaging the reputation of the target. Imagine being a 13-year-old girl discovering a cell phone picture of her changing clothes for gym class has been sent to all her classmates. Or imagine being an 11-year-old boy who is scared to go to school because an unknown bully sent him an instant message saying that he is so fat that he should kill himself. Cases such as these are happening every day, leading kids to be depressed and unable to concentrate.\nWorse yet, parents are oblivious   to what is happening. Only 15 percent of parents even know what cyber-bullying is. And anyone who thinks that their child is not a victim or a bully is probably wrong. 90 percent of middle school students have had their feelings hurt online and 75 percent have admitted to visiting a website attacking another student.\nUnlike traditional schoolyard bullying, where a bully has a name and a face, cyber-bullying gets much of its power from anonymity  . A cyber bully might design a website posting cruel remarks about a classmate and never tell anyone that he or she was the creator. The cyber-bullying also gets its power from the scope   of its audience. Within seconds, a cyber bully can send an e-mail to everyone he or she knows, inviting them to take part in an online poll   of who is the ugliest kid in their class. Victims can be picked on day and night from any place.\nThe good news is that you can help stop cyber-bullying. By making parents and educators aware of what is going on and encouraging them to take quick and strong action when cyber-bullying cases happen, you can help make technology constructive, not destructive, for young people.", "test": [{"id": "138_0", "num": 2569, "mcq": {"stem": "What does the author think of the cyber-bullying?", "choices": ["(A) It is not as harmful as people think.", "(B) It is too complex a problem to settle.", "(C) It will not affect the relationship between classmates.", "(D) It can be stopped through our efforts."], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "4||opinion", "pod": "inference", "items": "1", "phr": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 138, "id": "138_0", "num": 2569, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 907, "a_base_e": 992, "b_base_s": 1220, "b_base_e": 1272, "c_base_s": 374, "c_base_e": 514, "d_base_s": 1702, "d_base_e": 1757, "text_length": 1980}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "And anyone who thinks that their child is not a victim or a bully is probably wrong.

{"text": "As the new semester begins, millions of college students across the country are trying hard to remember how best to write a paper or, more likely, how best to delay that paper.\nProcrastination is the thief of time and a lot of students suffer from it. They can spend whole days in the library doing nothing but staring into space, eating snacks, surfing the Internet, watching videos and looking at other students sitting around them, who, most likely, are doing nothing either.\nParalyzed   by their habit to procrastinate, they write micro blogs about their fears, asking their online friends if they sometimes have the same issue. But this does nothing to break the spell  .\nAccording to a recent report, 95 percent of us procrastinate at some point and 20 percent of the world's population are always procrastinating. The figures are disappointing. Procrastinators are less wealthy, less healthy and less happy than those who don't delay. Procrastinators like to find excuses to justify their behavior, but BBC columnist Rowan Pelling says they are all wrong.\nMany procrastinators tell themselves they are perfectionists who work best under pressure. Pelling says this is nonsense, as work done at the last minute is more likely to have mistakes than work done on time. The behavior of procrastinators often makes them feel ashamed, inconveniences others and annoys loved ones.\nPelling also points out that procrastination feels particularly delinquent  in a society that thinks of speedy action as admirable, and, at times, even as a moral good.\nFortunately, social scientists have thrown their weight behind efforts to understand this behavioral mistake and offer strategies to control it.

Should laws be involved in this issue? Is it unfair to ban sales of fur, but not sales of leather and hides  ?\nAnimals Do Not Have Rights\nBy Tibor R. Machan\nMy view is that animals do not have basic rights. It is a matter of ethics   and not of the laws of human societies.

{"text": "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it.", "test": [{"id": "156_2", "num": 3015, "mcq": {"stem": "What does the author really mean by saying \"it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger\"?", "choices": ["(A) You should purposely go out and make these mistakes so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.", "(B) There are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.", "(C) When you get older, you'll have rich experiences to share with your friends and families however dumb you were", "(D) The younger you start, the fewer risks you can withstand and still come out with a positive return."], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "5||equivalent", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "4", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 156, "id": "156_2", "num": 3015, "key": "B", "b_base_s": 2989, "b_base_e": 3243, "text_length": 4192}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "If you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life.

The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser. The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250-foot Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by David Kirk, Chris Baker and Alan Weston of the Dangerous Sports Club. The jumpers continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982 they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot-air balloons. Later they put on commercial shows, which began in 1986.\nAs with any sport, injuries can still happen, and there have been deaths. A relatively common mistake in the cases that may cause death is to use a cord that is too long.

The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser. The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250-foot Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by David Kirk, Chris Baker and Alan Weston of the Dangerous Sports Club. The jumpers continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982 they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot-air balloons.

{"text": "Catherine and I were on our way to our nephew's birthday party one rainy Saturday morning, driving along what some people call moose  alley. It was early, there were few other cars on the road and we were looking forward to a good day with the family. Suddenly, a moose rushed across our path. Fortunately, a quick swerve  to the other lane prevented a full impact, with only a small collision on the right side of our car ripping off the mirror and knocking the moose to the pavement.\nBy the time I stopped and looked back in my rear view mirror, the moose was getting up. It ran into the bush. Shaken but unharmed, we both looked at each other shocked by what had happened. We knew that moose accidents had claimed many lives throughout the years, and that we had been very fortunate to escape with no personal injury or worse. After a quick check of our vehicle, we drove off.\nEven though the moose accident lasted just a few seconds, we still remember it to this day. Why?\nWe had often talked about the frailty of life, the here today and gone tomorrow potential we all face, but it had never felt so real. And it wasn't that we hadn't had friends, relatives and colleagues die before, it was that this experience was much more personal. In a matter of seconds, lives can easily change.\nThe effect of that one near miss with death has been positive, and made us appreciate life.

{"text": "Child labor -- the employment of children in industry, often against their will -- has been a problem for many years. Over a hundred years ago, Charles Dickens shocked many of his readers when he described the conditions under which young children worked in British factories. The conditions Dickens described continue almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined(limited)to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.\nGirls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to the health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative. The children not only receive nothing or very little for their long hours of work, but also they are prevented from attending school. Therefore, when they become older they are unable to do any other kind of work.\nThe solution to the problem of child labor is clearly better laws to protect young children, greater supervision of industry and heavier fines for those who break the laws.

{"text": "Climate change has been blamed for killer hurricanes, sea level rise, and drought, but a new report suggests the effects of climate change might hit the world's coffee supply. Up to 70 percent of the world's coffee supply could be threatened over the next 66 years, according to a new study by researchers at England's Royal Botanic Gardens.\nNearly 100 percent of the world's Arabica coffee growing regions could become unsuitable for the plant by 2080, according to the study. Beans from Arabica coffee plants account for about 70 percent of the world's coffee, but the plant also has to be grown under strict weather conditions: they grow well at temperatures between 64 and 70 degrees Celsius, and are highly influenced by frost or temperatures higher than 73 degrees Celsius.\nWith temperatures estimated to increase by between 1.8 and 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the fragile plant might become increasingly expensive and difficult to grow, especially in places such as Ethiopia and Kenya.

{"text": "Cutting global warming pollution would not only make the planet healthier, it would make people healthier too, new research suggested.\nCutting carbon dioxide emissions could save millions of lives, mostly by reducing preventable deaths from heart and lung diseases, according to studies released Wednesday and published in a special issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.\n\"Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives,\" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telecast briefing from her home state of Kansas. \"As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases. This is not a small effect.\"\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease.", "test": [{"id": "211_1", "num": 2669, "mcq": {"stem": "The new research differs from past studies in that   _  .", "choices": ["(A) it focuses on the immediate benefits of cutting carbon dioxide emissions", "(B) it studies the bad effects arising from future global warming", "(C) it is believed by more people", "(D) it mainly targets at developing countries"], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "5||difference", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 211, "id": "211_1", "num": 2669, "key": "A", "a_base_s": 767, "a_base_e": 947, "b_base_s": 778, "b_base_e": 836, "d_base_s": 1177, "d_base_e": 1341, "text_length": 2201}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "Instead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem", "start": 767, "end": 947}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "looking at the health ills caused by future global warming", "start": 778, "end": 836}, "c": null, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.", "start": 1177, "end": 1341}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Instead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.", "start": 767, "end": 1041}}}, {"id": "211_2", "num": 2670, "mcq": {"stem": "According to Kathleen Sebelius,   _  .", "choices": ["(A) sometimes it takes years to see the bad effects caused by consuming fossil fuels", "(B) without greenhouse gas emissions, people would not die of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases", "(C) the main reason why people get sick is that they rely on fossil fuels", "(D) deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are closely related to greenhouse gas emissions"], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "4||opinion", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 211, "id": "211_2", "num": 2670, "key": "D", "b_base_s": 640, "b_base_e": 737, "c_base_s": 382, "c_base_e": 520, "d_base_s": 640, "d_base_e": 737, "text_length": 2201}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases.", "start": 640, "end": 737}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives", "start": 382, "end": 520}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases.", "start": 640, "end": 737}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "\"Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives,\" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telecast briefing from her home state of Kansas. \"As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases.

{"text": "Cyberspace, the connections between computers in different places, considered as a real place where information, messages and pictures exist, mirrors the real world in many ways. People ask for information, play games, and share hobbies. Others buy and sell products. Still others look for friendship, or even love.\nUnlike the real world, however, your knowledge about a person is limited to words on a computer screen. Identity and appearance mean very little in cyberspace. Rather, a person's thoughts--or at least the thoughts they type--are what really count. So even the shyest person can become a chat room star.\nUsually, this \"faceless\" communication doesn't create problems. Identity doesn't really matter when you're in a chat room discussing politics or hobbies. In fact, this emphasis(,) on the ideas themselves makes the Internet a great place for exciting conversation. Where else can so many people come together to chat? But some Internet users want more than just someone to chat with. They're looking for serious love relationships. Is cyberspace a good place to find love? That answer depends on whom you ask. Some of these relationships actually succeed. Others fail miserably.\nSupporters of online relationships state that the Internet allows couples to get to know each other intellectually first. Personal appearance doesn't get in the way.

{"text": "Davey wanted to play baseball. But fifty years ago, in his small town, he couldn't find enough players for two full teams or an empty lot big enough for a field. And when he played ball in his back yard, he just broke windows and got into trouble. So Davey began playing with a plastic golf ball and a broom handle for a bat.\nWhen his dad, David Mullaney, a former semi-pro baseball pitcher , realized his son was hurting his arm trying to throw curves with the little plastic ball, he decided to find a better solution. Mullaney got a bunch of hollow plastic _ from a local factory, sat down at his kitchen table and began cutting different size holes in the balls with a razor knife. He thought maybe the holes would alter the ball's flight and help his son throw curves and sliders without hurting his arm.\nAll the balls failed--except the one with the eight oblong  holes cut into one of the hemispheres. This ball curved naturally and sharply without a violent snap of the wrist. In fact, Davey was now striking out so many batters; he called his new ball a \"wiffle ball\". A year later, Mullaney borrowed $20,000 from family and friends and started producing Wiffle Balls in his little suburban town of Shelton, Connecticut.\n\"I didn't want investors.\" He said, \"I wanted to control my own company.\" This was the beginning of one of the hottest fads  of the fifties and a perennial  best seller well known all around the world. Since then millions of boys and girls have enjoyed countless hours of safe, wholesome fun playing with a Wiffle ball and bat. Esquire Magazine has even called the Wiffle Ball \"a national treasure\". By producing a high quality product at an affordable price, three generations of Mullany's have enjoyed the satisfaction and benefits of running a successful and profitable family business.\nOver the years, they've had plenty of offers to buy them out, but they're still working out of a small factory in Shelton, making a new Wiffle Ball every couple of seconds.

{"text": "Dear Santa Claus,\nMy name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy. I just want one day when no one laughs at me or makes fun of me.\nLove,\nAmy\nAt radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully.  He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper.\nThe next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the \"News Sentinel\". The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television stations reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable, Christmas gift--just one day without teasing.\nSuddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other.\nMany people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high.\nAmy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at  South Wayne High School. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel.\nThat year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson. \"Everyone, \"said the mayor, \"wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth. \"", "test": [{"id": "223_0", "num": 491, "mcq": {"stem": "Amy's letter showed that   _   .", "choices": ["(A) her school wasn't a good place for students like her", "(B) her schoolmates cannot understand her disability", "(C) she wanted to win Christmas Wish Contest", "(D) she was often ignored in and out of class"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "4||evidence", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 223, "id": "223_0", "num": 491, "key": "B", "a_base_s": 52, "a_base_e": 79, "b_base_s": 104, "b_base_e": 164, "c_base_s": 309, "c_base_e": 358, "text_length": 2007}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "I have a problem at school.", "start": 52, "end": 79}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk.", "start": 104, "end": 164}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest.", "start": 309, "end": 358}, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Dear Santa Claus,\nMy name is Amy.

{"text": "Dreams can be familiar and strange, fantastical or boring, but some dreams might be connected to the mental processes that help us learn. In a recent study, scientists found a connection between nap-time dreams and better memory in people who were learning a new skill.\nIn the study,99 college students between the ages of 18 and 30 each spent an hour on a compute, trying to get through a virtual maze .The maze was different place each time they tired--making it even more difficult. They were also told to find a particular picture of a tree and remember where it was.\nFor the first 90 minutes of a five-hour break, half of the participants stayed awake and an half were told to take a short nap .Participants who stayed awake were asked to describe their thoughts. Participants who took a nap were asked about their dreams before sleep and after sleep--and they were awakened within a minute of sleep to describe their dreams.\nStickgold, a neuroscientist ,wanted to know what people were dreaming about when their eyes weren't moving during sleep.\nFour of the 50 people who slept said their dreams were connected to the maze. Some dreamed about the music that had been playing when they were working ; others said they dreamed about seeing people in the maze. When these four people tried the computer maze again, they were able to find the tree faster than before their naps.\nStickgold suggests the dream itself doesn't  help a person learn--it's the other way around.He suspects that the dream was caused by the brain processes associated with learning.\nAll four of the people who dreamed about the task had done poorly the first time, which makes Stickgold wonder if the dreams show up when a person finds a new task particularly difficult.

{"text": "Drownings, bicycle injuries, falls, and pedestrian accidents are the most common causes of childhood injury or death. Here's what you need to know to avoid tragedy:\n      Drowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n      Falls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision  \n      Bikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n      Pedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior. Cross at the corner and when you do cross, continue to look both ways because there are likely to be more cars turning into your path or people speeding.

This is creating problems for polar bears that make their homes off northern Alaska and in Hudson Bay.\nPolar bears off Alaska normally hunt and raise their young on ice sheets that float on the ocean. But as the ice has melted, the polar bears have been forced to spend more time on land. There, they have begun to frequent beaches, feeding on the remains of whales caught by native hunters. For polar bears, this food is less nutritious than seals that they normally catch on ice sheets. The shrinking  ice has also forced more polar bears into the ocean. In the past, they only had to swim short distances between ice sheets. But as the ice has shrunk, polar bears have been forced to swim longer and longer distances in the open ocean. This poses a severe danger during rough weather, and an increasing number of drowned polar bears have been observed.\nIn Hudson Bay, the ice breaks up three weeks earlier in the spring now than it did 20 years ago. Polar bears on Hudson Bay fast  during the summer, waiting for ice to form in the fall to hunt. Every year, the summer gets longer, and the bears get skinnier. Over the past 25 years, the average weight of the female bears has dropped 68 kg. This loss affects their ability to reproduce, and already the number of births has dropped 15 percent.

{"text": "During the tsunami   disaster of 2004, over 300,000 people died. No one has counted the number of animals killed, but we know that it wasn't many. All over the region, before the disaster struck, animals were behaving strangely.\nShortly before the tsunami, in Khaolak, Thailand, twelve elephants that were giving tourists rides became agitated. They suddenly left their usual habitat, carrying four surprised Japanese tourists to safety. On the eastern coast of India, flamingos  , which should be breeding at this time of year, suddenly flew to higher ground. Of the two thousand wild pigs that live in an Indian nature reserve, only one was found dead after the tsunami.\nThe idea that the animals are able to predict disasters is nothing new. In fact, it has been well-recorded over the years. Twelve hours before Hurricane Charlie hit Florida in 2004, fourteen sharks left their natural habitat and stayed in deep waters for two weeks. The sharks, which were being observed by US scientists, had never done this before. They escaped the hurricane. In the winter of 1975 in Haicheng, China, snakes which would normally have been hibernating   were seen on the ground. Days later there was a big earthquake striking.\nUnlike human beings, wild animals' senses are sharper and they can feel even the smallest changes in the environment. In other words, they see natural warnings that are invisible to the human eye. Ancient people probably had the similar \"senses\", which they needed to survive, but these have been lost to us as modern technology leads us further away from the danger that nature creates.\nThe real question is, can we use the reactions of animals to save ourselves from natural disasters? Animal behaviour expert, Rupesh Kaneira, believes we have no choice. \"The technology which we rely on isn't always perfect, and in poorer countries it isn't even available.

{"text": "Every day we meet people in a number of business and social situations. And the way we meet and greet them creates an impression. It's important to do so in a proper way, no matter whether you are introducing yourself to someone, or introducing two people. To keep you aware of this, we have gathered tips on how to make a proper introduction.\nAlways stand when making an introduction.\nWhen you are seated and someone comes up to greet you, make the effort to stand up. By doing this, you show respect for yourself and for the other person.\nAlways keep eye contact while making an introduction.\nMany people are not aware of the value of this simple action. When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.\nAlways introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.\nFor example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. \"Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?\"\nIn a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.\nWhat if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.\nHowever, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name.

{"text": "Every few years, two groups carry out a study of how many Americans wash their hands after using the toilet. These groups are the American Society for Microbiology and the American Cleaning Institute, formerly the Soap and Detergent Association.\nThere was good news in the latest study. Researchers found that eighty-five percent of adults washed their hands in public restrooms last month. That was the most since the studies began in 1996.\nResearchers visited restrooms at a baseball park in Atlanta and a science museum and aquarium  in Chicago. They also visited two train stations in New York City and a large farmers' market in San Francisco. In all, they observed about six thousand adults, with females and males equal in number.\nThe researchers found that seventy-seven percent of men and ninety-three percent of women washed their hands. That was up from sixty-six percent of men and eighty-eight percent of women in the last study three years ago.\nThe lowest rate of hand washing among men was at Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. Only sixty-five percent of men washed their hands, compared to all but two percent of women.\nChicago and San Francisco had the most hand washers--eighty-nine percent of adults. Atlanta followed at eighty-two percent. New York had the lowest rate, at seventy-nine percent of the adults observed at Grand Central Station and Penn Station.\nThe findings of the observational study conflicted  with the findings of a separate telephone survey of about one thousand people. Ninety-six percent of them said they always washed their hands after using public restrooms.\nAlmost nine out of ten also said they always washed after using the bathroom at home.\nHand washing can help prevent the spread of many different infections.\nTo clean your hands well, wet them first and rub in soap for at least twenty seconds, including between the fingers and under the nails. Then wash under running water. In a public restroom, if you dry your hands with a paper towel, you should also use the towel to shut off the water and open the door.\nHand washing is also important when preparing food and after changing a baby's diaper .

{"text": "Every year, Americans send millions of tons of food to the landfill  . What if you could use all of those rotten vegetables to heat your home? That's happening in one unlikely laboratory: the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plan in Brooklyn\nThe plant's longtime manager, Jimmy Pynn, shows off the plant's crown jewels: eight huge, shiny, oval-shaped steel tanks known as digester eggs. Each one contains millions of gallons of black material that's roughly pea soup. Pynn calls it \"black gold\". \"The digesters like to be fed like us: three times a day,\" he says. \"They like to be kept warm, 98 degrees. And that's what we have these guys for: to make methane ,which can be used to heat homes or make electricity.\"\nRight now, what these bacteria are digesting is mostly sewage  mud. But they are being introduced to a new diet food scraps. The hope is that this plant will soon take in hundreds of tons of organic waste from houses and apartments.\n\"Cardboard packaging, rotten tomatoes, fats, oils, old diary products--those are all great food-stuff for a digester,\" says Paul Sellew. \"My micro-organisms love that. That's their five-course meal.\"\n\"Everything in New York City is like big scale when you're talking about quantities of waste,\" says Samantha MacBride. \"Right now, it's all in its infancy. When you're in an apartment building, to separate out food scraps, it requires a lot of effort and attention,\" says MacBride. \"It doesn't have to have unpleasant smell or be inconvenient. But it takes extra work. It's the first, what I will call the baby step,\" says Paul Sellew. \"Because ultimately in New York City, just the restaurants alone, you're talking well over a million tons a year,\" he says.\nThis new industry is trying to build more plants and digesters to handle all of that waste, says Sellew. The costliest part may be finding good locations in or around the nation's biggest cities.\nAs for the trillions of bacteria?

{"text": "Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal. For real - you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations and their high image   of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?\nWell, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. Repeated psychology tests have proved that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a \"social reality\". The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then, because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So, this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals.\nPeter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.\n    It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests - everyone wrote down their personal goals.Then, half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them toward their goals, but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go to still achieve their goals. But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goals.\nSo audience, next time you want to tell someone your goal, what will you say?

The majority of students who use Facebook every day are doing badly compared with those who don't. About 83% of British 16 to 24-year-old people are using social networking site such as Facebook and MySpace, to keep in touch with friends and organize their social activities.\n\"Our study shows people who spend more time on Facebook spend less time studying,\" said Aryn Karpinski, a researcher. \"Every generation has its distractions , but I think Facebook is a unique phenomenon.\" Karpinski and a colleague questioned 219 US undergraduates and graduates about their study and general Internet use, as well as their specific use of Facebook. They found 65% of Facebook users accessed their account daily, checking it several times to see if they had received new messages.

{"text": "Family Vs Technology\nModern technology certainly changes family behavior, but does it really damage family life as many people fear? Not necessarily, says Dr. Silva, a professor in Sociology  at the Open University, she also argues it is wrong to assume technology erodes(,) the quality of family life.\n\"There is the idea that technology has an influence on the family and the family suffers. My take is quite different,\" she explains. \"Technological change happens because people's lives change. And it is people's choices of how to live that creates processes of innovation  as well. The family has a role like the economy or like technology itself in changing the world. The imagination is important in driving the things technologists want to find for our daily lives. People desire to see nature as it is, so color television comes about,\" she says.\nIn another case, the increase in working mothers helped create a market for labor-saving kitchen equipment. \"The time that women have to shop every day for food is no longer available so there is a need to have a refrigerator for food storage,\" says Dr. Silva. \"The need to cook that food more easily and quickly, means you have developments in cooking technology like the microwave oven . The microwave oven already existed because it was developed for the navy during World War Two but it wasn't used in ordinary families until the early 1980s.\n\"Technologies for housework were as important as those for work itself,\" she says, \"So washing machines, refrigerators and microwave ovens are terribly important. We couldn't imagine what life would be like if we didn't have them.\" Technological changes in the kitchen have played an important role in the changes of family behavior, creating a new social focus in the home.\n\"With advanced technology, you can feed the family in an easier manner. People can do housework with less difficulty.

{"text": "From a very early age, some children show better self-control than others. Now, a new study that began with about 1,000 children in New Zealand has tracked how a child's low self-control can predict poor health, money troubles and even a criminal record in their adult years.\nResearchers have been studying this group of children for decades now. They observed the level of self-control the youngsters displayed. Parents, teachers, even the kids themselves, scored the youngsters on measures like \"acting before thinking\" and \"Persistence in reaching goals.\"\nThe study led  by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1,000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\"The children who had the lowest self-control when they were age three to ten, later on had the most health problems in their 30s,\" Moffitt said,\"and they had the worst financial situation. They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a single parent on a very low income.\" Moffitt explained that self-control problems were widely observed, and weren't just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids.\nMoffitt said it's still unclear why some children have better self-control than others, though she said other researchers have found that it's mostly a learned behavior, with relatively little genetic influence. But good self-control can be set to run in families because children with good self-control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents.

citizens, showed.\nForty percent of people who responded to the telephone survey, whose average age was 69, reported spending more than $500 on grandchildren over the past year beyond traditional gifts.Education costs accounted for 53 percent, daily expenses for 37 percent and medical costs for 23 percent.Sixteen percent provided daycare for grandchildren.\n\"They are the safety net for American families, helping to pay for practical expenses and necessities,\" said Amy Goyer, AARP's multi-generational and family issues   expert.\n\"We see many providing daycare services, while growing numbers even have grandchildren living with them,\" she said, referring to the 16 percent who watch their grandchildren while the parents are at work or school.\nGenerally nearly 90 percent of the 1,904 grandparents questioned said they play a very or somewhat important role in their grandchildren's lives, and about 70 percent live within 50 miles of the closest one.\nThe poll conducted by Woelfel Research Inc.also showed that grandparents were increasingly keyed to the younger generation's life issues and preferred ways of communicating.\nMore than one-third connect with their grandchildren via email or text messaging, while half said they routinely discuss topics ranging from values and spirituality to drug and alcohol use.\nNearly 40 percent said they had discussed dating

{"text": "Give it five minutes\nI used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said anything, I'd think of a way to disagree. I'd push back hard if something didn't fit my world-view.\nIt's like I had to be first with an opinion -- as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn't thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.\nThis came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn't have to do that.\nAnd what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn't agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole.\nHis response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it's fine to disagree, it's fine to push back, it's great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you're sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\nThis was a big moment for me.\nRichard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He's given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it's better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you're right.\nThere's also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.\nLearning to think first rather than react quick is a life-long pursuit. It's tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn't. But I'm really enjoying all the benefits of getting better.\nIf you aren't sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs' reverence(respect) for ideas:\nAnd just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\nThat's deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They're barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss.\nThere are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people's money and 2. Dismissing an idea.\nDismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn't involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That's easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.\nSo next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it's too hard or it's too much work.\nThose things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.", "test": [{"id": "316_0", "num": 308, "mcq": {"stem": "What did the author do while Richard was talking in the business conference?", "choices": ["(A) He kept notes for things that he did not agree with.", "(B) He pushed Richard and beat him.", "(C) He was preparing for his own speech.", "(D) He was getting ready to compliment him."], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "2||action", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 316, "id": "316_0", "num": 308, "key": "A", "a_base_s": 745, "a_base_e": 847, "b_base_s": 700, "b_base_e": 721, "text_length": 3443}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn't agree with.

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition   and heat-related health problems.\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change.

If the Internet had only this very fast search engine, it would have justified its existence many times over. It is the most popular search engine on the web with a 54% market share, ahead of Yahoo! You type almost anything, however unclear, into the space provided and in a second it has come up with hundreds of references. If knowledge is power, then Google commands the gateway.\nYahoo Becomes Giant\nYahoo(www.yahoo.com) was the first wonder of the web, and in many respects, it still is. It started in January 1994 when two California graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, started compiling a database of links, mainly for their personal use. But well before the end of the year, it had become recognizable as Yahoo we know today. In the past seven years, Yahoo had grown rapidly, partly through a long string of buys. Yahoo now offers almost everything you could want: emails, instant messages, chats, clubs, photo albums and a lot more.\neBay Enables Everyone to Buy and Sell\neBay(www.ebay.com),which deals with online trading and shopping services, is the most impressive large Internet company where people buy and sell goods and services worldwide. It has, for instance, opened up a global marketplace in which people from Beijing, San Francisco, or Moscow can bid against each other for products put up for sale by someone in London.

The material's inventors say it has a number of possible uses and someday could provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic.

Plastic's toughness and flexibility represented a revolution in materials science during the 1950s and '60s. Decades later, however, plastic's very durability   is raising questions about how appropriate it is for one-time products such as plastic bags, or short-lived consumer goods, used in the home for a few years and then cast into a landfill where they will degrade for centuries. What is the point of making something that lasts 1,000 years?\nShrilk not only will degrade in a landfill, but its basic components are used as fertilizer , and so will enrich the soil.\nShrilk has great potential, the inventors said. Materials from which it is made are plentiful in nature, found in everything ranging from shrimp shells, insect bodies to living plants. That makes shrilk low cost, and its mass production possible should it be used for products demanding a lot of material.\nWork on shrilk is continuing in the lab. The inventors said the material becomes flexible when wet, so they're exploring ways to use it in wet environments.

Schedules tend to be flexible,with business meetings sometimes starting later than planned.But to be safe,be on time.Meals can stretch for hours--there's no such thing as rushing a meal in

{"text": "High Speed Book Scanner\nSimply turning pages of a book quickly may not seem like the best way to scan it. A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes. Scanning text is normally a boring process with each page having to be inserted into a scanner, but the team led by Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa uses a high speed camera that takes 500 pictures a second to scan pages as they are turned by workers.\nNormal scanners can only scan the information that is actually before them on the page. This high speed book scanner uses a camera that captures pages at 1000fps as they are turned. A system built in allows it to automatically correct any changes to the text due to the page bending as well as light differences due to shadows. \"It takes a shot of the shape, then it calculates the shape and uses those calculations to film the scanning,\" Ishikawa said, explaining the system used to reconstruct the original page.\nThe current system is able to scan an average 250-page book in a little over 60 seconds using basic computer hardware. While it now requires extra time to process the scanned images  , the researchers hope to eventually make the technology both faster and much smaller. \"In the more distant future, once it becomes possible to put all of this processing on one chip   and then put that in an iPad or iPod, one could scan just using that chip. At that point, it becomes possible to scan something quickly to save for later reading,\" Ishikawa said.\nBeing able to scan books with an iPhone may be further off, but Ishikawa says that a commercial version of the large-scale computer based scanning system could be available in two or three years.

{"text": "I have a painfully vivid memory of my first homecoming from college, in December 1983. After three whole months away, I was back home with my brand new opinions, attitudes and tastes. How could they watch such terrible television programs? I, the English Literature major with Shakespeare and Milton and James Joyce, could hardly bear to sleep under the roof of a house whose few bookshelves held thrillers and bound editions of the Reader's Digest. I'm sure my family was glad to see the back of me when, at the end of the holiday, I packed up my books and headed back up to university in the north of England.\nBut the next year must have been even more painful to my parents: I didn't show up at all. Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with young people spending a little time away from their families and with their friends.  It's part of growing up, something you need to do if you are to become properly independent. However, if you're not going to be home for the festival, you should at least have the decency to telephone and say you're not coming.\nIn English we have an expression, \"wet behind the ears.\" A person who is wet behind the ears is so immature, that they don't know how to dry the back of their head after a bath. Just before the following year's holiday I fell ill, quite seriously so. I'm sure my own behavior contributed to my getting sick: staying out too late, not eating properly--perhaps you know someone like the person I was then. I lay in bed with a fever, feeling very sorry for myself.\nI'm sure you can guess who came to my rescue. My long-suffering parents got in their car and sped up the motorway to rescue their son from the consequences of his own irresponsibility.\nI hope I'm a better son now; if not, it's getting a little late in the day if I want to change. I've worked in China for nearly 10 years and so I don't get to see them as often as I like, but my parents are online all the time so we talk many times each week.

{"text": "I was now in my twenty third year of residence in this island and was accustomed to the place and to the manner of living. If it had not been the savages who had come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to spent the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave.\nI had also arrived to some little recreations and amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before.\nAt first, I had taught my Poll to speak. And he did it so familiarly and talked so clearly and plain that it was very pleasant to me. And he lived with me no less than twenty six years. How long he might live afterwards, I don't know; though I know they have an idea in Brazil that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling Poor Robin Crusoe to this day. I wish no other English man had the bad luck to go there and hear him.

{"text": "If you are ever planning to buy a telescope and want to get yourself involved in astronomy it is always a good idea to know a bit of the sky.Get acquainted with a few constellations  so that it will be easier for you to spot the constellations when you are using your telescope.\nIt's a good idea to buy a few magazines on astronomy to help you to get familiar with the constellations in the sky and also read a few reviews on the different types of telescopes in the market.This will help you gather all the information that is out there regarding telescopes and what people have to say about them.\nIt's advisable to go in for a pair of binoculars  before you buy your first telescope so that you can get used to spotting constellations before your view of the sky is narrowed down.This will also help you know if you really want to get involved in astronomy.Many people buy a costly telescope and then discover that they're not actually interested in astronomy.\nExperience has no substitute,and there certainly is nothing better than using different telescopes before you buy one.This will help you to get the feel of all the types of telescopes and you will know which one is easier for you to use.A large aperture  refractor  may give you an excellent image but you may not be able to keep a steady hand while using it resulting in a blurry image.\nThere are three types of telescopes that are available in the market.If you want a more elegant looking telescope you can always choose to buy a fine brass telescope.It's good to become acquainted with each type before going for the plunge of a first telescope.The first type of telescope is the refractor telescope,which uses lenses to gather light to a focus at the eye piece.The use of lenses helps the telescope have a superior image.A refracting telescope is not as portable as the other two types of telescopes and so you will have to buy one with a small aperture.\nThe second type of telescope is the Reflector.Made by Sir Isaac Newton,this telescope functions by focusing the light back at the front of the tube,which is where the eyepiece sits,by using parabolic  mirrors and another smaller mirror to deflect the

Against this backcloth of nature, Reykjavik has a packed program of familiar city joys too: art museums, several theaters, an opera house, a symphony orchestra and concerts meeting the needs of all ages and tastes.\nOne must for all visitors is dining out on Icelandic specialties, including delicious seafood, ocean-fresh from the morning' s catch, highland lamb and unusual varieties of game. Its purely natural food is imaginatively served to delight the most discerning of diners. Reykjavik is also famous as one of Europe's hottest nightspots, where the action on the friendly pub and nightlife scene lasts right through the night. In the evening, the downtown area is filled with activity, reaching its peak on Friday or Saturday. The number of pubs, cafe, discos, and other nightspots in the downtown area is astonishing. There is a rich variety of places to go: European-style cafes, nightclubs with live entertainment, dance halls for seniors, sports-theme pubs with big TV screens, cafes that offer over 100 types of beer, an Irish pub, a Spanish cafe, a French wine bar.\nWalking distances are short downtown, and everything worth seeing outside the city center can be quickly and conveniently reached by bus. With its long, easy-going main street and large shopping mall, Iceland's capital is a great place to shop too -- with a bonus of tax-free shopping for visitors!\n A full range of accommodations is available in Reykjavik, from international-standard hotels with good conference facilities, through smaller hotels and comfortable guesthouses, to a campsite in the city's biggest park.", "test": [{"id": "416_0", "num": 1378, "mcq": {"stem": "It can be learned from the passage the Reykiavik_.", "choices": ["(A) was named by the ancient gods.", "(B) was named by Iceland's first settler.", "(C) got its name from the visitors.", "(D) was named after Iceland's first settler."], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "3||assertion", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 416, "id": "416_0", "num": 1378, "key": "B", "a_base_s": 512, "a_base_e": 647, "b_base_s": 512, "b_base_e": 647, "d_base_s": 512, "d_base_e": 619, "text_length": 2545}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "Old accounts say the ancient gods themselves guided Iceland's first settler to make his home in Reykjavik.

{"text": "If you're a man and you're reading this, congratulations: you're a survivor. According to statistics, you're more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman, and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Even if you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you'll die on average five years before a woman.\n  There're many reasons for this--typically, men take more risks than women and are more likely to drink and smoke--but perhaps more importantly, men don't go to the doctor.\n  \"Men aren't seeing doctors as often as they should,\" says Dr. Gullotta. \"This is particularly so for the over-40s, when chances of diseases are higher .\"\n  Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two.

{"text": "In 1974, after filling out fifty applications, going through four interviews, and winning one offer, I took what I could get ----- a teaching job at what I considered a distant wild area: western New Jersey. My characteristic optimism was alive only when I reminded myself that I would be doing what I had wanted to do since I was fourteen ------- teaching English.\nSchool started, but I felt more and more as if I were in a foreign country. Was this rural area really New Jersey? My students took a week off when hunting season began. I was told they were also frequently absent in late October to help their fathers make hay on the farms. I was a young woman from New York City, who thought that \"Make hay while the sun shines\" just meant to have a good time.\nBut, still, I was teaching English. I worked hard, taking time off only to eat and sleep. And then there was my sixth-grade class ---- seventeen boys and five girls who were only six years younger than me. I had a problem long before I knew it. I was struggling in my work as a young idealistic teacher. I wanted to make literature come alive and to promote a love of the written word. The students wanted to throw spitballs and whisper dirty words in the back of the room.\nIn college I had been taught that a successful educator should ignore bad behavior. So I did, confident that, as the textbook had said, the bad behavior would disappear as I gave my students positive attention. It sounds reasonable, but the text evidently ignored the fact that humans, particularly teenagers, rarely seem reasonable. By the time my boss, who was also my taskmaster, known to be the strictest, most demanding, most quick to fire inexperienced teachers, came into the classroom to observe me, the students exhibited very little good behavior to praise.\nMy boss sat in the back of the room. The boys in the class were making animal noises, hitting each other while the girls filed their nails or read magazines. I just pretended it all wasn't happening, and went on lecturing and tried to ask some inspiring questions. My boss, sitting in the back of the classroom, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger. After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.\nI felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him. I wondered if he would let me finish out the day. I walked to his office, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\nHe was sitting in his chair, and he looked at me long and hard. I said nothing. All I could think of was that I was not an English teacher; I had been lying to myself, pretending that everything was fine.\nWhen he spoke, he said simply, without accusation, \"You had nothing to say to them.\"\n\"You had nothing to say to them\". he repeated.\" No wonder they are bored. Why not get to the meat of literature and stop talking about symbolism. Talk with them, not at them. And more important, why do you ignore their bad behavior\"? We talked. He named my problems and offered solutions. We role-played. He was the bad student, and I was the forceful, yet, warm teacher.\nAs the year progressed, we spent many hours discussing literature and ideas about human beings and their motivations. He helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. In short, he made a teacher of me by teaching me the reality of Emerson's words: \"The secret to education lies in respecting the pupil.\"\nFifteen years later I still drive that same winding road to the same school.

{"text": "In recent years many countries of the world have been faced with the problem of how to make their workers more productive. Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor.\nOther experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is true. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be used in a fixed way. Thus while freedom of choice may be important, there is usually very little that can be done to create it.\nAnother very important consideration is how each worker contributes to the product he is making. In most factories the worker sees only one part of the product. Some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor, therefore, but it is also one we can do something about.\nTo what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more. A similar argument may explain demands for shorter working hours. Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them.", "test": [{"id": "439_0", "num": 3101, "mcq": {"stem": "Which of the following is the best way to make workers work harder according to the author?", "choices": ["(A) Increasing their pay.", "(B) Giving them more spare time.", "(C) Making the work itself meaningful.", "(D) Replacing large production lines with small ones."], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "3||alternative", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "phr": "2", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 439, "id": "439_0", "num": 3101, "key": "C", "a_base_s": 1471, "a_base_e": 1543, "b_base_s": 1545, "b_base_e": 1660, "c_base_s": 1661, "c_base_e": 1812, "d_base_s": 1021, "d_base_e": 1127, "text_length": 1812}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring", "start": 1471, "end": 1543}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more.

It also has a high number of game players who are addicted to online games.\nIn 2004, a young man died after playing online games almost nonstop for 86 hours. A 12-year-old boy stole $16,000 from his father to continue online games which he could not get away from. Such problems are spreading to other parts of Asia as well.

{"text": "It has been argued that an infant under three who is cared for outside the home may suffer because of the separation from his parents.The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby believes that separation from the parents during the sensitive \"attachment\" period from birth to three may scar   a child's personality and incline to emotional problems in later life.Some people have drawn the conclusion from Bowlby's work that children should not be sent to day care before the age of three, and many people do believe this.But there are also arguments against such a strong conclusion.\nFirstly, anthropologists   point out that the hidden love between children and parents found in modem societies does not usually exist in traditional societies.For example, we saw earlier that among the Ngonis the father and mother of a child did not raise their infant alone.But traditional societies are so different from modern societies that comparisons based on just one factor are hard to understand.\nSecondly, common sense tells us that day care would not be so widespread today if parents and caretakers found that children had problems with it.But Bowlby's analysis raises the possibility that early day care has delayed effects.The possibility that such care might lead to more mental illness or crime 15 or 20 years later can only be noticed by the use of statistics.Statistical studies of this kind have not yet been carried out, and even if they were, the results would be certain to be complicated and controversial.\nThirdly, in the last decade, there have been a number of careful American studies of children in day care, and they have reported that day care had a neutral of slightly positive effect on children's development.But tests that have had

I shouted into the phone that I had a plane to catch and I would meet the taxi outside my house.\nStanding in the wind-driven rain, I looked up and down the road. No taxi. A car went by, the driver and passenger staring at the crazy foreigner in the downpour.\nFinally a white car appeared and pulled to a stop. A young man threw open the door, waving for me to get in. Shaking with cold and anger, I climbed in.\nIn the most polite Japanese, the man said he was called Mike, with who I had spoken three times that morning. He had left his post in the office and raced here in his personal car. He apologized again, but didn't explain why a taxi would not pick me up.

I became fond of her cheerful chatter, constant laughter ,and addiction to online shopping. She seldom took my unkind jokes seriously and always gave it right back to me, making our relationship closer. She could go on talking for hours about the beach outside her house, her family and  friends, and her life at her school.\nWhile several aspects were very similar to my life here, I was always left with a certain level of mystery and excitement as I wondered how the picture in my head compared with reality.\nThrough hard work, she became fluent in English in almost no time. While this was a big success for her, it made me ashamed as I was not forced to develop the little Spanish that I was learning in class. This experience aroused my interest in traveling to Europe - especially Spain. While l know that not everyone has this same interest in other culture, I believe that it is important for us to be willing to learn about what makes certain customs and activities significant to them As Americans, we may be some of the most arrogant( ) people about other culture, which history has proven can have disastrous consequences.

{"text": "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \"", "test": [{"id": "507_0", "num": 2865, "mcq": {"stem": "How did John Blanchard get to know Miss Hollis Maynell?", "choices": ["(A) They lived in the same city.", "(B) They were both interested in literature.", "(C) John knew Hollis's name from a library book.", "(D) John came across Hollis in a Florida library."], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "3||manner", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 507, "id": "507_0", "num": 2865, "key": "C", "b_base_s": 245, "b_base_e": 320, "c_base_s": 0, "c_base_e": 14, "d_base_s": 245, "d_base_e": 320, "text_length": 3684}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "His interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library.

{"text": "MONTAGNE: In the summer of 2011, the world first heard of a small island in Norway under the most terrible of circumstances. Utoya Island was a youth camp run by Norway's Labor Party. One day in July, a heavily armed, right-wing extremist stepped onto the island and began shooting at random. Sixty-nine people died, over 100 were wounded; almost all, young people. This month, artist Jonas Dahlberg was appointed to create a memorial. He described to us the experience he imagines for those who come to the island.\nDAHLBERG: You start your walk through a forest of evergreens on a wooden pathway. After a while, this pathway starts to go down into the landscape.\nMONTAGNE: Down into the landscape, and into a short tunnel. When you come out, you are unable to go any farther. You can't get to the tip of the island because it has been cut off. So all you can do is look across a narrow channel of water at what is now a wall of polished stone, carved with the names of the dead.\nDAHLBERG: It becomes almost like a gravestone. You cannot reach it. It's close enough to be able to read, but it's forever lost for your possibility to reach.\nMONTAGNE: It's being called _ . Exactly what do you mean by that?\nDAHLBERG: During my first site visit, the experience of seeing those gunshots--and you can see it was like being in an open wound. And it took me to a stage of deep sadness where it was hard to breathe. So I didn't want to illustrate loss; I wanted to make actual loss. It's just a cut through the island.\nMONTAGNE: On the day of the massacre, just hours before launching his shooting on the island, the killer set off a bomb in downtown Oslo, leaving eight people dead. As those events were unfolding, artist Jonas Dahlberg had been out with his brother, and stopped in at a seaside village.\nDAHLBERG: In the harbor, it was silent, and this is the higher end of summer. So, it's normally a very lively place. And it was total silence there; and it was a very, very strange feeling in the whole small village. And it's totally impossible to grasp what is going on. And then it just kept on. It's still almost impossible to understand it. It's also one of the reasons why it's so important with memorials for these kind of things. It's to maybe help a little bit to understand what was happening. So it's not just about remembering.

{"text": "Many kids don't drink enough water daily, according to a new study. The study's lead author, Erica Kenney, at first planned to look into the amount of sugary drinks kids were drinking in schools. However, during her research she found that many kids were simply not drinking enough water.\nKenney and her team examined data from a group of 4,000 children, aged 6 to19, between the years of 2009 and 2012. The data was taken from the National Health and Nutrition Survey,a study on the health of children in the United States conducted each year by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention..\nWhile looking through the survey results, she noticed that more than half of the kids who took part in the study were dehydrated  . Of' that group, boys were 76% more likely than girls not to have enough water in their system. Nearly one quarter of the kids in the survey reported drinking no plain water at all.\n\"These findings highlight  a possible health issue that wasn't given a lot of attention in the past,\" Kenney said in a statement. \"Even though for most of these kids this is not an immediate and great health threat, this is an issue that could really be reducing quality of life and well-being for many children and youth.\"\nThe United States-National Agriculture Library says average kids need between 10 to 14 cups of water every day. This water can come from a mix of drinks and foods that contain high amounts of water, such as celery, melons or tomatoes.

{"text": "May 28 (Reuters Life!) - A Japanese university is giving away Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) trendy iPhone to students for free, but with a catch: the device will be used to check their attendance.\nThe project, which is being tested ahead of its formal launch in June, involves 550 first and second year students and some staff of a department at Aoyama Gakuin University, which is located just outside Tokyo in Sagamihara city.\nThe school's iPhones are meant to create a mobile information network between students and professors, but they are also a convenient way for the teachers to take attendance in class. As students enter the room, instead of writing their name on a sheet, they simply type in their ID number and a specific class number into an iPhone application. To prevent students from logging in from home or outside class, the application uses GPS location data and checks which router the students have logged in to.\n\"We don't want to use this to simply take attendance. Our hope is to use this to develop a classroom where students and teachers can discuss various topics,\" professor Yasuhiro Iijima told Reuters as he demonstrated the application.\nUniversity officials insist the project is not intended to infringe on students' privacy or track them down.\n\"With Japanese cellphones it's possible that the location data is automatically sent. However, with the iPhone, you must always confirm before the GPS data can be sent,\" Iijima said.\nMany of the students testing the system said they were happy with it.\n\"Up until now, we've been using little slips of paper to take attendance. But with a cell phone, you don't have to spend time collecting all of those and so I think it's quite nice,\" 20-year-old student Yuki Maruya.\nWhen the system goes fully online next month, the university also hopes to provide video podcasts of lectures to help students who missed classes, or just can't remember their lessons.", "test": [{"id": "560_2", "num": 3379, "mcq": {"stem": "Teachers at Aoyama Gakuin University can finish taking attendance by asking students to  _", "choices": ["(A) write their names on the paper", "(B) Type in their ID and class numbers into iphone", "(C) log in from home or outside class ahead", "(D) put in right GPS location data and their router"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other LM", "toi": "2||action", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 560, "id": "560_2", "num": 3379, "key": "B", "a_base_s": 642, "a_base_e": 671, "b_base_s": 603, "b_base_e": 763, "c_base_s": 765, "c_base_e": 827, "d_base_s": 829, "d_base_e": 922, "text_length": 1919}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "writing their name on a sheet", "start": 642, "end": 671}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "As students enter the room, instead of writing their name on a sheet, they simply type in their ID number and a specific class number into an iPhone application", "start": 603, "end": 763}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "To prevent students from logging in from home or outside class", "start": 765, "end": 827}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "the application uses GPS location data and checks which router the students have logged in to", "start": 829, "end": 922}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": "formatting inconsistency", "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": ["case/capitalisation inconsistency"], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "The school's iPhones are meant to create a mobile information network between students and professors, but they are also a convenient way for the teachers to take attendance in class.

Animals make thousands of proteins -- they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates   for making protein drugs.\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA -- the code that tells cells how to make proteins -- so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis  .\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites.

With Gallimore signed on to produce, Andrews soon had a recording contract  with Dream Works' Nashville label.\nAndrews' professional career was launched with 1999's Heart Shaped World, recorded when she was 14 years old. The album included the country hit I Will Be There For You, which also appeared on The Prince Of Egypt . She followed up the release of the album by touring as a support act for such country superstars as Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood.\nWith the release of 2001's, Who I Am, Andrews became a star in her own right. The album was certified  gold for sales of 500,000 copies. Andrews returned in April 2003 with Now,an album that she promised would show a new side of the young artist. \"This album has a very different feeling for me,\" she said. \"It's a lot more personal and there's a confidence that wasn't quite there on the first two.

{"text": "Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants.

{"text": "More than two thirds of the world's polar bears will be wiped out by 2050,according to a shocking new study. By then,scientists say,global warming will have melted 42 percent of the Arctic sea ice. By 2100,only a very few of these important creatures will be left.\nThe report has been produced by the US Geological Survey. The scientists have publicized their findings in the hope of influencing US Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne,who has been asked to put polar bears on the US endangered species list.\nPolar bears depend on floating sea ice as a platform for hunting seals,which are their main food. Without enough ice,polar bears would be forced to go onto the land,where they are poorly skilled hunters,and would be unlikely to adapt to the life on the land in time. Experts say few little bears would survive and the stress could make many females unable to get pregnant.\nThe team of American and Canadian scientists spent six months studying bears,on the ground,from spotter planes and in the lab,using computer models.\nSome team members fear the result is even worse for the bears than what their report says. They say the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere in the world and much faster than their computer had been forecasting. Satellite observations have showed that the ice has decreased to an all-time low.\nHowever,not everyone in the scientific community believes that global warming is happening on such an alarming scale.

{"text": "My favourite book is The Adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain.Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri.He's a lively and clever young boy,and he finds himself in many exciting adventures.He runs away with his two friends,Huck Finn and Joe,to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days.With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave.and finally,they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead.He decides to go to his own funeral.He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is astonished to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story,but there are other important characters.Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him.Becky is pretty with fair hair,Joe is Tom's best friend.and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the  story  is about children growing up.It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are  punished for bad behaviour.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today.

{"text": "My mother, Marisol Torres, came with her family to Australia in the early 1960s. Then my parents' marriage ended and Mum began the study of precious stones. Her interest in opals   took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge. There were no luxuries  , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money.\nMy mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year.\nPeople who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle.\nDanny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else...

I was curious by how one moved one's body to protect oneself, how one used a strategy both to attack and retreat, how one paced oneself over a match,\" he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom.\n2. His original name was not Nelson.\nRolihlahla Mandela was nine years old when a teacher at the primary Methodist school where he was studying in Qunu, South Africa, gave him an English name \"Nelson\" in accordance with the custom to give all school children Christian names.\n3. He forgot his glasses when he was released from prison.\nMr. Mandela's release on 11 February 1990 followed years of political pressure against apartheid . Mr. Mandela's reading glasses stayed behind in prison Mr. Mandela and his then-wife Winnie were taken to the centre of Cape Town to address a huge and exciting crowd. But when he pulled out the text of his speech, he realized he had forgotten his glasses and had to borrow Winnie's.\n4. He had his own law firm, but it took him years to get a law degree.\nMr. Mandela studied law on and off for 50 years from 1939, failing about half the courses he took. A two-year diploma  in law on top of his university degree allowed him to practice, and in August 1952, he and Oliver Tambo set up South Africa's first black law firm, Mandela and Tambo, in Johannesburg. He kept on studying hard to finally secure a law degree while in prison in 1989.", "test": [{"id": "611_0", "num": 2824, "mcq": {"stem": "What is the main idea of the passage?", "choices": ["(A) Nelson Mandela's life in the prison.", "(B) The achievements of Nelson Mandela.", "(C) Nelson Mandela's hobbies and career.", "(D) Unknown things about Nelson Mandela."], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "either is HLTI", "toi": "4||theme", "pod": "inference", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 611, "id": "611_0", "num": 2824, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 924, "a_base_e": 979, "b_base_s": 1365, "b_base_e": 1432, "c_base_s": 202, "c_base_e": 222, "d_base_s": 114, "d_base_e": 197, "text_length": 1816}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "He forgot his glasses when he was released from prison.", "start": 924, "end": 979}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "He had his own law firm, but it took him years to get a law degree.", "start": 1365, "end": 1432}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "He was a boxing fan.", "start": 202, "end": 222}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "But here are four things you may not have known about the late South African leader", "start": 114, "end": 197}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Nelson Mandela was a figure of international fame, and many details of his life and career were public knowledge.

{"text": "Once upon a time two brothers who lived on neighbouring farms fell into conflict. It was the first serious one in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery, and trading labor and goods as needed .\nThen the long cooperoration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence. \nOne morning there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm looking for a few days' work\" he said. \"Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there I could help with. Could I help you?\" \n\"Yes,\" said the older brother. \"I do have a job for you. Look across the creek  at that farm. That's my neighbor, in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow  between us and he took his bulldozer  to the river levee  and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll go him one better.

I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" \nThe older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing, and hammering. \nAbout sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. \nThere was no fence there at all. It was a bridge -- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work -- and his younger brother, was coming across, his hand spread out .. \n\"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done.\" \nThe two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days.

{"text": "Over the years, Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, has studied such things as how far Americans typically drive to buy food, how many times we refill our plates at all-you-can-eat buffets and how we organize our kitchens. In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.\nHis new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\"\nWansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.\nThe point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits.

{"text": "PEOPLE who have had a painful experience may wish they could wipe the memory from their minds. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, US, say that this may someday be possible.\nA drug remains far off, but researchers have laid a foundation with their discovery that proteins can be removed from the brain's fear center to cut memories forever.\nPrevious research had already shown that a special behavior therapy   could cut painful memories. But relapse   was possible because the memory hadn't necessarily disappeared.\nBy looking at that process, Richard Huganir and Roger Clem, two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, discovered a \"window of vulnerability  \" when proteins are created. The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made. Because the proteins are unstable, they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories.\nResearchers used mice to find the window, but think the process would be the same in humans. They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound. The sound triggered   the creation of the proteins, called calcium-permeable   AMPARS, which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice's brains.\nThe researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling   the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein. They published their report online last month in Science Express.\nTheir research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare.\nKate Farinholt, a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maryland, US, said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory. \"Erasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea, and I can see all sorts of potential ,\" she said.\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions, too.\n\"Completely deleting a memory is a little scary.

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing!", "test": [{"id": "677_0", "num": 1820, "mcq": {"stem": "When the rock forces its way through the Earth's crust,   _  .", "choices": ["(A) a volcano is born", "(B) an earthquake happens", "(C) a fault forms", "(D) the Earth's covering becomes smooth"], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LM", "toi": "2||action", "pod": "one distractor", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 677, "id": "677_0", "num": 1820, "key": "A", "a_base_s": 1850, "a_base_e": 1939, "b_base_s": 676, "b_base_e": 728, "c_base_s": 2096, "c_base_e": 2146, "d_base_s": 1578, "d_base_e": 1640, "text_length": 2506}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then?

{"text": "People want action on noise, a recent public meeting in Brisbane showed.Some want technical improvements such as quieter air conditioners or better sound barriers around major roads.Others want tougher laws to restrict noise from building sites or to require owners to take responsibility for barking dogs.But the highest priority was a noise complaints system that works.\nBrisbane City Council receives more complaints about noise than all other problems put together.So it conducted a survey and found that about half its residents are upset by noise in one form or another -traffic, mowers, pool pumps, air conditioners or loud parties.This inspired the Council to bring together more than 100 citizens one evening to talk through a range of options.\nThe meeting found the present regulatory system bizarre.Depending on the problem, responsibility for noise can lie with the Council, the Environment Protection Authority, one of three government departments or even the police.So complainants often feel they are getting the run-round.When the people at the forum were asked to vote for changes, the strongest response was for a 24-hour noise hotline to be the first part of call for all complaints.\nThe forum also favored regulatory measures, such as tougher minimum standards for noise in appliances like air conditioners.This even makes economic sense, as noise is a waste of energy and money.Other measures the meeting supported were wider buffer   zones around noisy activities and controls to keep heavy traffic away from residential areas.\nBut there are obvious conflicts.Many people like to have a bar within walking distance if they feel like a drink, but they don't want a noisy pub keeping them awake when they want an early night.Most people want to live near a major road providing good access to other parts of the city, but they don't' want the problem of road noise.\nI was most interested by the proposals aimed at behavioral change.There was strong support for measures to reduce traffic: better public transport, cycle ways and footpaths, even charges for road use.Many people optimistically thought industry awards for better equipment would

{"text": "People with disabilities make up a large part of the population. It is estimated  that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental\", i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious\", i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces.\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently.

{"text": "Recently educators have been questioning \"prep school\" (=preparatory school)   where barely literate   high school athletes get their transcripts   by taking courses occasionally and sometimes by taking no courses at all. The athletes then go on to famous sports universities, where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees.\nThe prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A., which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem, has finally adopted policies to root it out. But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved, including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit   students who do not meet academic standard.\nThe prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods, where young people too often ignore their studies, believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents. Even worse, it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation--at which point their grade-point averages would be written in stone--to sign up with fake schools that can help them rewrite their academic records.\nThe N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some. The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.\nThese measures are encouraging as far as they go. But the N.C.A.A. will need to go much deeper into the problem if it hopes to break this scheme. For starters, it needs to make clear not just what courses high school athletes need to take to become qualified for college sports, but when they should take them. Until that happens, those who recruit young athletes will always be tempted to make fake academic record at the last possible moment for them.", "test": [{"id": "695_1", "num": 1774, "mcq": {"stem": "From the passage we can infer that   _  .                 .", "choices": ["(A) High school students can change their transcripts by transferring to another school or take a lot of courses in one term.", "(B) Transcripts of high school students can be very important reference for students to go to college.", "(C) Most High school athletes can probably be awarded a bachelor's   or master's degree after they graduate from universities.", "(D) Transcripts of high school students are so important that they are recorded on metal"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "3||assertion", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 695, "id": "695_1", "num": 1774, "key": "B", "a_base_s": 1433, "a_base_e": 1730, "b_base_s": 1433, "b_base_e": 1621, "text_length": 2184}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.", "start": 1433, "end": 1730}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average,", "start": 1433, "end": 1621}, "c": null, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "The N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some.

Complete with a timer, a whistle and 50 willing singles, speed dating is not the traditional dinner and a movie type of first date. Singles pay US $35 for three minutes with more than two dozen future dates. They ask questions and try to get to know each other. At the sound of a whistle, they do the same thing all over again--25 times in all.\nLock and key party\nWomen are given a lock and men are given a key, upon arriving at the party. Each key and lock has several matches. One can hunt for his/her later-to-be sweetheart in various groups, and try out the key or lock. Each time a lock and key match the pair are entered into a ballot  for top prizes!\nDinner in the dark\nWaiters wearing night vision glasses guide the guests through the pitch-black dining room.

He had been forced to take a job stocking shelves at a local grocery store for $8.90 an hour when he couldn't get work fixing floors.\nOn a good day in Australia, he now makes as much as 50 Australian dollars (US$50.21) an hour--about twice the amount for a typical flooring job in the U.S. He plans to start his own flooring business. \n\"I can make what I did in a week in the U.S. in less than a day here,\" said Mr. Davila, who lives near a mining boom town in Western Australia.\nAustralian government figures show just under 7,000 Americans currently working on long-term visas, an 80% jump over the past five years. U.S. citizens are now the third-largest group applying for so-called 457 work visas, after British and Indian nationals. Americans with degrees in areas such as accounting or mine engineering, as well as other skilled workers, can obtain a nonrenewable  permit for as much as a three-year stay. After that, they can apply for the renewable 457, which allows up to a four-year stay. \nThe need for workers is particularly pressing in Western Australia. The mining state's unemployment rate was 4.5% in November, below the national average of 5.2%.

{"text": "School is out for the summer in some areas, and for many children, that means weeks of sleeping in late, trips to the swimming pool or hours spent in front of the TV. These months of inactivity--- away from the daily tiring things of school--- are something that young people look forward to, but it can have a detrimental influence on the knowledge they have.\nStudies have shown that children lose a lot in math skills during the summer months. Children who spend little time learning experience a much greater amount of learning loss than those who often take part in summer programs.\nSo when school starts again in the fall, teachers often have to spend several weeks reteaching children material that they have forgotten.\nExperts suggest that parents make sure the summer months are a time of continued learning. For example, they suggest that lunch time is good time to improve a child's spoken skills, simply through conversation. A trip to the supermarket can be an opportunity to improve a child's math skills by having him or her add up the cost of food. And there is no better way to prevent learning loss than by having a child read every day.\nFortunately, there are many programs that can help parents. The best place to start is at your local library. Most libraries have summer reading programs that are filled with fun activities. A. strong musical education also improves learning. Find out summer music camps in your area.\nWe think that children should have fun during the summer break, but it should not be a vacation from learning.

{"text": "Scientists estimate that more than 60 percent of cancer deaths in the United States are preventable through lifestyle changes. Although there is no certain way to avoid all cancers, reducing individual risk factors greatly decreases the likelihood of getting many forms of this dangerous disease.\nThe American Chemical Society estimates that smoking causes nearly 30 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States -- that is, about 166,000 cancer deaths each year. All cancer deaths caused by tobacco smoking could be prevented completely by not smoking and not using smokeless tobacco. For those who already smoke, quitting will reduce the risk of developing cancer. Studies show that after about ten years of not smoking, a past smoker's risk lowers to about the level of those who have never smoked.\nAfter quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet is the best way to lower the risk of cancer. Certain foods have been found to protect against cancer. Among these foods are cabbages, tomatoes, soy products, and foods high in vitamins A, C, and E. In addition, green and possibly black teas contain compounds that protect the body from cancer-causing substance.\nTo lower cancer risk, diets should include little or no red meat. Other foods to avoid or consume in moderation   include sugar, fat from animal products, and salt. Added fats and oils should come from vegetables, such as olives or corn, rather than from animal sources. Carbohydrates   should come from whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat bread, rather than from processed foods, such as white rice and white bread.\nThe risk of cancer of the esophagus   increases with heavy alcohol consumption, and many studies suggest that consuming alcoholic drinks increases the risk of breast cancer as well. Studies show that limiting intake to two drinks a day for men, and one drink per day for women, reduces cancer risk.\nLow levels of physical activity have been implicated   in some cancer.

{"text": "September is an exciting month in every college freshman's life. For many, it's the first time that they've left home to live in a new environment. But after the hustle and bustle of a few weeks, excitement gives way to a less enjoyable emotion-- homesickness.\nHomesickness manifests itself in many ways. You may miss mum's cooking, your pets, or even your old bed. All this becomes a fond memory of the past. Homesickness can be a bitter feeling for many students, especially when faced with the challenges of settling into an unfamiliar environment.\nBut remember, you're not alone. According to a recent BBC article, 70 percent of British college students experience homesickness. In this increasingly globalized world in which people migrate to faraway places for a relationship, education or work, homesickness is a feeling shared by many adults.\nHomesickness can have similar symptoms to depression and in extreme cases it can develop into a panic attack. As for the term, homesickness or nostalgia wasn't invented until the 17th century. It was considered a disorder by a Swiss physician, who attributed soldiers' mental and physical discomfort to their longing to return home, \"nostos\" from Greek, and the accompanying pain, \"algos\".\nStudies in recent years, however, have shown that nostalgia may have some benefits to our mental health.

{"text": "Shakespeare's Sister\nLet us imagine, since facts are so hard to come by, what would have happened had Shakespeare had a wonderfully gifted sister, called Judith.\nShakespeare himself went, very probably -- his mother was an heiress -- to the grammar school, where he may have learnt Latin -- Ovid, Virgil and Horace -- and the elements of grammar and logic. He was, it is well known, a wild boy who poached   rabbits, perhaps shot a deer, and had, rather sooner than he should have done, to marry a woman in the neighborhood, who bore him a child rather quicker than was right. That escapade sent him to seek his fortune in London. He had, it seemed, a taste for the theatre; he began by holding horses at the stage door. Very soon he got work in the theatre, became a successful actor, and lived at the centre of the universe, meeting everybody, knowing everybody, practicing his art on the boards, exercising his wits in the streets, and even getting access to the palace of the queen.\nMeanwhile his extraordinarily gifted sister remained at home. She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as curious to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school. She had no chance of learning grammar and logic, let alone of reading Horace and Virgil. She picked up a book now and then, one of her brother's perhaps, and read a few pages. But then her parents came in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew  and not moon about with books and papers. They would have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were practical people who knew the conditions of life for a woman. Soon, however, before she was out of her teens, she was to be engaged to the son of a neighboring wool stapler . She cried out that marriage was hateful to her, and for that she was severely beaten by her father. Then he ceased to scold her. He begged her instead not to hurt him, not to shame him in this matter of her marriage. He would give her a chain of beads or fine dresses, he said; and there were tears in his eyes. How could she disobey him? How could she break his heart?\nThe force of her own gift alone drove her to it. She made up a small parcel of her belongings, let herself down by a rope one summer's night and took the road to London. She was not seventeen. The birds that sang in the woods were not more musical than she was. She had the quickest fancy, a gift like her brother's, for the tune of words. Like him, she had a taste for the theatre. She stood at the stage door; she wanted to act, she said. Men laughed in her face. The manager -- a fat, loose-lipped man -- howled with laughter. He roared something about puppies dancing and women acting -- no woman, he said, could possibly be an actress. She could get no training in her craft. Could she even seek her dinner in a bar or roam   the streets at midnight? Yet her genius was for fiction and lusted to feed abundantly upon the lives of men and women and the study of their ways. At last -- for she was very young, oddly like Shakespeare the poet in her face, with the same grey eyes and rounded brows -- at last Nick Greene the actor-manager took pity on her; she found herself with child by that gentleman and so -- who shall measure the heat and violence of the poet's heart when caught and confined in a woman's body? -- killed herself one winter's night and lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses   now stop outside the Elephant and Castle.\nThat, more or less, is how the story would run, if a woman in Shakespeare's day had had Shakespeare's genius.", "test": [{"id": "721_0", "num": 662, "mcq": {"stem": "What can we infer from Judith's teen life?", "choices": ["(A) She was cared for but was expected to live a girl's life.", "(B) She was willing to be engaged to a wool stapler.", "(C) Her father wanted to make a fortune by her marriage.", "(D) She got less affection from her parents than her brother."], "key": "A"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "3||assertion", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 721, "id": "721_0", "num": 662, "key": "A", "a_base_s": 1459, "a_base_e": 1578, "b_base_s": 1627, "b_base_e": 1689, "c_base_s": 1909, "c_base_e": 1968, "d_base_s": 1128, "d_base_e": 1159, "text_length": 3528}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": " They would have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were practical people who knew the conditions of life for a woman.", "start": 1459, "end": 1578}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "she was to be engaged to the son of a neighboring wool stapler", "start": 1627, "end": 1689}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "He would give her a chain of beads or fine dresses, he said", "start": 1909, "end": 1968}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "But she was not sent to school.", "start": 1128, "end": 1159}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Meanwhile his extraordinarily gifted sister remained at home.

{"text": "Shopping in the United States changes a lot.About ninety years ago most people shopped in small stores that were owned by one person or a family.Women went from the bakery to the butcher's to the grocer and on to the fruit and vegetable seller in order to get their food for the week.\nThen about sixty years ago, supermarkets were born.In a supermarket, people could get all the different kinds of food they needed without going to different stores.\nThe next big change in shopping in the United States was the shopping mall.A shopping mall is a group of stores under one roof.Because malls allowed people to shop without worrying about the weather, they soon became very popular.The mall became a place for people to socialize in addition to shopping.If you walk through a mall, you will see older people sitting, chatting and drinking coffee.Malls are places for teenagers to hang out.Many teens will often just \"go to the mall\" and spend time with their friends.\nThe recent change in American shopping was the superstore.Large chain stores such as Wal-Mart, Office Depot and Toys \"R\" Us have been built all across the United States.Because they are so large, they can buy goods at a great discount and sell them much cheaper than smaller stores.\nSometimes, when they are built near small towns, many of the small town stores have to close.They just cannot compete with their giant neighbors.\nAnd now, online shopping is becoming more and more popular all over the States.People are too busy to go to the physical stores, so they go shopping over the Internet.Online shopping has lots of advantages.For instance, online stores are usually available 24 hours a day.Searching or browsing online shops can be faster than browsing the physical stores.While, online shopping also has its disadvantages.People are at higher risk of being cheated on the part of the merchant than in a physical store.And privacy of personal information may be let out.", "test":

{"text": "Should doctors ever lie to benefit their patient---to speed recovery or to cover the coming of death? In medicine as in law, government, and other lines of work, the requirements of honesty often seem dwarfed   by greater needs: the need to protect from brutal news or to uphold a promise of secrecy; to advance the public interest.\nWhat should doctors say, for example, to a 46-year-old man coming in for a routine physical check up just before going on vacation with his family who, though he feels in perfect health, is found to have a form of cancer that will cause him to die within six months. Is it best to tell him the truth? If he asks, should the doctor reject that he is ill, or minimize the gravity of the illness? Should they at least hide the truth until after the family vacation?\nDoctors face such choices often. At times, they see important reasons to lie for the patient's own sake; in their eyes, such lies differ sharply from self-serving ones.\nStudies show that most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill patients do not want to know the truth about their condition, and that informing them risks destroying their hope, so that they may recover more slowly, or deteriorate   faster, perhaps even commit suicide.\nBut other studies show that, contrary to the belief of many physicians; a great majority of patients do want to be told the truth, even about serious illness, and feel cheated when they learn that they have been misled. We are also learning that truthful information, humanly conveyed, helps patients cope this illness: help them tolerate pain better, need less medicine, and even recover faster after operation.\nThere is urgent need to debate this issue openly. Not only in medicine, but in other professions as well, practitioners may find themselves repeatedly in difficulty where serious consequences seem avoidable only through deception  . Yet the public has every reason to know professional deception, for such practices are peculiarly likely to become deeply rooted, to spread, and to trust.

{"text": "Six seconds after its launch in Virginia, US, an unmanned rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS) exploded, disappointing people both on Earth and in space.\nHundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo was destroyed in the Oct. 28 explosion due to An\"equipment failure\", said Orbital Sciences, the company hired by NASA for the resupply mission.\nThe rocket was carrying a cargo ship loaded with 2,200 kilograms of supplies such as food, tools, parts, and experiments. Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations. Some of them were from high school students in the US. For example, 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket.  \"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .\nAstronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment, however. The cargo included 617kg of food. Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct. 29.\nLaunched in 1998 and involving the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the member countries of the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history. Currently, there are six astronauts at the station, five male and one female. Three are from Russia, two are from the US, and one is from Germany.  They have lived together for about six months. The station gets regular resupplies from Earth, using unmanned spacecrafts. Food is always a big part of the supplies.  Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat, and often tastes bad-somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold.\nTo make space life better, however, scientists have made breakthroughs. Earlier this year, Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station. Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants. And, as transporting water to space is expensive, astronauts are looking for ways to recycle water. \"Astronauts on board the ISS already drink water distilled from sweat and urine<) ,\" Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported.\nIs that the reason the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission, by any chance?", "test": [{"id": "736_1", "num": 3445, "mcq": {"stem": "How did teacher Greg Adragna feel about the explosion of the rocket?", "choices": ["(A) Angry.", "(B) Anxious.", "(C) Frustrated.", "(D) Unconcerned."], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other SM", "toi": "3||predicate adjective", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 736, "id": "736_1", "num": 3445, "key": "C", "c_base_s": 787, "c_base_e": 872, "text_length": 2316}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": null, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "\"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" ", "start": 787, "end": 872}, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "\"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .", "start": 787, "end": 931}}}, {"id": "736_2", "num": 3446, "mcq": {"stem": "We can conclude from the article that the situation seemed  _  for astronauts on board the ISS when the rocket exploded.", "choices": ["(A) hopeless", "(B) interesting", "(C) depressing", "(D) dangerous"], "key": "C"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other SM", "toi": "3||predicate adjective", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "3", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 736, "id": "736_2", "num": 3446, "key": "C", "c_base_s": 2211, "c_base_e": 2300, "text_length": 2316}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": null, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission", "start": 2211, "end": 2300}, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Is that the reason the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission, by any chance?", "start": 2192, "end": 2316}}}, {"id": "736_3", "num": 3447, "mcq": {"stem": "Which of the following statements is TRUE about the ISS, according to the article?", "choices": ["(A) Half of the astronauts at the ISS are from the US.", "(B) The ISS was set up by four countries.", "(C) The water that astronauts at the ISS drink is mainly made by recycling.", "(D) Most of the food astronauts eat at the ISS is frozen and tastes bad."], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other LM", "toi": "3||verification", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 736, "id": "736_3", "num": 3447, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 1300, "a_base_e": 1447, "b_base_s": 1105, "b_base_e": 1220, "c_base_s": 1965, "c_base_e": 2191, "d_base_s": 1615, "d_base_e": 1735, "text_length": 2316}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "Currently, there are six astronauts at the station, five male and one female.

The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.\n              The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\" and \"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\" The same questions were asked about fathers.\n              People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers.

Most have to pay for these activities. Some adults question if high school students should have jobs. \nSome people worry that teens with after-school jobs will struggle to find time for homework. Actually, the responsibility of having a job helps teens prioritize their time. Many jobs take only a couple of  hour shifts on weeknights. According to a survey, 86 percent of high school students have an after-school, weekend or summer job and students who work between 10 and 20 hours per week during the school year have statistically higher grades-point averages than those who do not work at all. Those who work in high school are more likely to work in college, and financing their college education is a top reason for undergraduates to look for employment. Instead of considering jobs a barrier, employment should be looked at as real-world education. \nOther people think that work adds too much stress, which may be somewhat true, but regardless of having a job or not, there is always going to be stress.

{"text": "Spring is here and so is the cycling season. Here are some tips on how to do it safely and comfortably.\nWatch your feet--Pushing with the wrong part of the foot can raise your risk of developing a painful injury of the heel and arch , says Rob Werstine, a sports physiotherapist and board member of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association.  You should push with the ball of your foot, he says.\nLayer up--While it's still cool, wear layers of clothing, with clothing close to the body that breathes and outer layers that do not absorb water. Go for bright colors that increase your visibility .\nBe reasonable--If you are just starting out and aren't in good shape, don't sign up for a 50-kilometre ride. And while cycling is great exercise for people who want to get into shape, if your doctor advises you not to do tiring exercise, cycling shouldn't be your starting position, Werstine says. Walk to begin getting into shape and then graduate to cycling.\nFix the fit--If you develop lower back pain or numbness in your hands and fingers from cycling, it could be your bike isn't adjusted properly for your height.

{"text": "The Streisand Effect\nWhen Barbra Streisand discovered in 2003 that a photograph of her California beach house was among 12,000 photos on the Internet as part of a collection by a photographer Kenneth Adelman, she did what any famous person would do: hit him with a $50 million lawsuit  . But in trying to hold back the images, she caused a different result. Her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the website, viewing and copying the photos within a month.\nEver since then, the effect of letting public know something you are trying to keep secret has been called the \"Streisand effect\". The problem for anyone trying to cover up information is that the Internet is the world's biggest and most useful copying machine. Put a document   on to a connected machine and it will spread. So when you want to be famous, you can't, but if you find yourself receiving too much attention and want to remove yourself, you cannot.  \nThere are many examples of the Streisand effect. Nine-year-old Martha Payne created a simple blog, posting the meals her school served. She took a photo of what was hardly a satisfying meal by anyone's standards. With the photo, she added a comment, \"Now Dad understands why I am hungry when I get home.\" The thing did not go too far, until the local authority   banned   little Martha from doing that again. Martha posted a final post called \"Goodbye\", explaining everything. Once the media found this out, things went from bad to worse for the authority. Now the blog has more than 9.5 million page views. Martha has even expanded her blog by including pictures of school meals taken by other kids from all over the world, like Germany and Japan.\nWe can find similar examples throughout history. Man has experienced the Streisand effect ever since the birth of mass communication. Why does it exist? Every time you are told not to see what's in the secret shiny box wrapped in gift paper, you're going to do everything in your power to do exactly that! Just realizing that knowing something about someone is harmful to their status, we will want to know that piece of information. This is exactly the human nature. This is what lawyers and authorities should be familiar with.

{"text": "The U. S. Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars a year. The government company that delivers \"small mail\" is losing out to email and other types of electronic communication. First-class mail amount fell from a high point of 104 million pieces in 2000 to just 64 million pieces by 2014.\nCongress permits the 600.000-empIoyee USPS to hold a monopoly   over first-class and standard mail. The company pays no federal, state or local taxes; pays no vehicle fees; and is free from many regulations on other businesses. Despite these advantages, the USPS has lost $52 billion since 2007, and will continue losing money without major reforms.\nThe problem is that Congress is preventing the USPS from reducing costs as its sales decline, and is blocking efforts to end Saturday service and close unneeded post office locations. USPS also has a costly union-dominated workforce that slows the introduction of new ideas or methods down. USPS workers earn significantly higher payment than comparable private-sector workers. The answer is to privatize the USPS and open postal markets to competition. With the rise of the Internet, the argument that mail is a natural monopoly that needs government protection is weaker than ever.\nOther countries facing declining letter amounts have made reforms Germany and the Netherlands privatized their national postal companies over a decade ago, and other European countries have followed suit. Britain floated shares of the Royal Mail on its stock exchange in 2013. Some countries, such us Sweden and New Zealand, have not privatized their national postal companies, but they have opened them up to competition.\nThese reforms have driven efficiency improvements in all of these countries. Additional number of workers have been reduced, productivity has risen and consumers have benefited. Also, note that cost-cutting measures--such as closing tone post offices--are good for both the economy and the environment.\nPrivatization and competition also encourage new changes. When the USPS monopoly over \"extremely urgent\" mail was stopped in 1979, we saw an explosion in efficient overnight private delivery by firms such as FedEx.\nThe government needs to wake up to changing technology, study postal reforms abroad and let businessmen reinvent our out-of-date postal system.", "test": [{"id": "803_0", "num": 512, "mcq": {"stem": "What do we know about the USPS?", "choices": ["(A) Its great competitor is the delivery firm FedEx.", "(B) It is an old public service open to competitions.", "(C) Its employees don't pay federal, state or local taxes.", "(D) It has complete control of first-class and standard mail."], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other LM", "toi": "4||evidence", "pod": "one distractor", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 803, "id": "803_0", "num": 512, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 2091, "a_base_e": 2174, "b_base_s": 1028, "b_base_e": 1103, "c_base_s": 400, "c_base_e": 449, "d_base_s": 300, "d_base_e": 399, "text_length": 2318}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "we saw an explosion in efficient overnight private delivery by firms such as FedEx.", "start": 2091, "end": 2174}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "The answer is to privatize the USPS and open postal markets to competition.", "start": 1028, "end": 1103}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "The company pays no federal, state or local taxes", "start": 400, "end": 449}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "Congress permits the 600.000-empIoyee USPS to hold a monopoly   over first-class and standard mail.", "start": 300, "end": 399}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Congress permits the 600.000-empIoyee USPS to hold a monopoly   over first-class and standard mail.

Memorizing phone numbers\nIt was annoying to remember numbers. Now we simply add them to our contacts list. That usually works well unless our device is lost,stolen,or damaged. No one can be expected to remember all their contact numbers. What we can do is memorize 5 of our most important contact numbers. This should include a mixture of family,friends and business. If you're really ambitious you can memorize 5 contacts for each category.\n2. Map-reading skills\nThe convenience and effectiveness of GPS guidance systems and digital maps generated by search engines is unquestionable. They've definitely made our lives easier. What we don't get from using these devices and applications is the increased ability to understand spatial orientation and navigation.\nTo renew or acquire those skills,try using physical maps to plan your next trip. After a few trips,you'll be pleasantly surprised with how useful a physical map can be.\n3. Photography\nEven amateur photography requires a basic learning about lighting,depth,and composition. This is true for digital photography. Most smart cameras automatically make these adjustments. We no longer have to learn the art of photography. On most devices,this is easily changed by turning off the automatic settings. Experiment with setting by hand the scene modes,lighting,and zoom. You just may learn that you're a \"true photographer\".\n4. Reading comprehension\nThe primary cause is E-reader. They're convenient and can store thousands of books. But there's evidence that E-reader makes it more difficult for readers to keep and recall information they just read. Don't worry! What we should do is make an effort to read printed books.

In case you're thinking of buying a steamer, I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best.\nFolding Steamer\nThe simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel  version.\nAdvantages: This is a good, basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of pans with the water under it; a ring in the center allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean.\nDisadvantages: It only holds small dishes. Also, if you put too much water in the pan, it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery. If you put too little water in and let it get dry, you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables.\nSteaming Pan\nThis is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled steamers, which sits on the oven ring. The brand I bought is called Nutritious Living.\nAdvantages: This is an excellent steamer, lightweight, easy to clean, and of all the steamers I've tried, this cooks the fastest. Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top. It's easier to store.\nDisadvantages: Water can boil away until the pan is dry, but if you make sure you fill the pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food, this should not happen.You cannot see the food cooking from the top.

{"text": "The literal meaning of philosophy is \"love of wisdom\". But this meaning does not tell us very much. Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.\nTwo broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.\nOf what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement.

{"text": "The modern Olympic Games, founded in 1896, began as contests between individuals, rather than among nations, with the hope of promoting world peace through sportsmanship. In the beginning, the games were open only to amateurs. An amateur is a person whose involvement in an activity---from sports to science or the arts---is purely for pleasure. Amateurs, whatever their contributions to a field, expect to receive no form of compensation ; professionals, in contrast, perform their work in order to earn a living.\nFrom the perspective of many athletes, however, the Olympic playing field has been far from level. Restricting the Olympics to amateurs has precluded  the participation of many who could not afford to be unpaid. Countries have always desired to send their best athletes, not their wealthiest ones, to the Olympic Games.\nA slender and imprecise line separates what we call \"financial support\" from \"earning money.\" Do athletes \"earn money\" if they are reimbursed  for travel expenses? What if they are paid for time lost at work or if they accept free clothing from a manufacturer or if they teach sports for a living? The runner Eric Liddell was the son of poor missionaries; in 1924 the British Olympic Committee financed his trip to the Olympics, where he won a gold and a bronze medal. College scholarships and support from the United States Olympic Committee made it possible for American track stars Jesse Owens and Wilma Rudolph and speed skater Dan Jansen to train and compete. When the Soviet Union and its allies joined the games in 1952, the definition of amateur became still muddier. Their athletes did not have to balance jobs and training because as citizens in communist regimes, their government financial support was not considered payment for jobs.\nIn 1971 the International Olympic Committee(IOC) removed the word amateur from the rules, making it easier for athletes to find the support necessary to train and compete. In 1986 the IOC allowed professional athletes into the games.\nThere are those who regret the disappearance of amateurism from the Olympic Games. For them the games lost something special when they became just another way for athletes to earn money. Others say that the designation of amateurism was always questionable; they argue that all competitors receive so much financial support as to make them paid professionals.

{"text": "The story of Juno and Lucas is one of the most touching stories about the amazing relationship between humans and their companion animals.\nJuno is a Belgian Malinois . The dog was beautiful but was given up by its owners, as they did not want to take on the responsibility.\nLucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years.\nChester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the $15,000 cost of the animal.\nNot terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed  in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, \"She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure  or if his oxygen levels drop really low.

{"text": "The sunflower plant bears bright yellow flowers that always face the sun, hence the name. However, the plant is grown not only for its beautiful flowers, but also for its oil that has a host of health benefits. Sunflower oil prevents diseases, lowers cholesterol levels, keeps the heart healthy, and even prevents certain forms of cancer. Sunflower oil is a kind of \"magic oil\" when it comes to skin care, as it makes your skin soft and smooth, and prevents signs of aging. So, let us know more about its effects on your skin.\n1. It Acts as an Effective Emollient .\nSunflower oil is an effective emollient, which means that it helps the skin retain moisture. Thus, people with dry skin can benefit immensely from the regular use of the oil. Also, it is mild, and provides relief from irritation and inflammation of the skin.\n2. It Offers Sun Protection.\nSunflower oil is a rich source of vitamin E. The high vitamin content prevents the sensitive cells of the skin from being damaged by the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. Also, the beta-carotene (b-) present in sunflower oil helps neutralize  free radicals that are responsible for causing damage to the skin, including sunburn and skin cancers.\n3. It Prevents Earlier Aging.\nVitamin E present in sunflower oil not only protects the skin from sun damage, but also from earlier aging. What's more, regular use of sunflower oil can reduce wrinkles and make one look younger. Also, sunflower oil is rich in antioxidants  that keep the skin fresh.\n4. It Prevents Skin Infections .\nSunflower oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids that protect the skin from bacterial infections. Hence, it gives you a healthy skin.\n5. Additional Effects.\nThere are other ways in which sunflower oil can prove to be a boon for your skin. These are given as follows:\nIt helps reduce dark spots; it helps lighten dark circles; it helps soften rough and dry skin; it can be used to remove make-up; it helps relax tired eyes.", "test": [{"id": "849_0", "num": 3440, "mcq": {"stem": "Sunflower oil can be good for the following EXCEPT   _  .", "choices": ["(A) reducing cholesterol levels", "(B) preventing heart diseases", "(C) making skin smooth and impressive", "(D) curing some kinds of cancers"], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "2||procedure", "pod": "two or more\ndistractors", "phr": "1", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 849, "id": "849_0", "num": 3440, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 245, "a_base_e": 269, "b_base_s": 270, "b_base_e": 294, "c_base_s": 339, "c_base_e": 444, "d_base_s": 300, "d_base_e": 337, "text_length": 1960}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "owers cholesterol levels", "start": 245, "end": 269}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": " keeps the heart healthy", "start": 270, "end": 294}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "Sunflower oil is a kind of \"magic oil\" when it comes to skin care, as it makes your skin soft and smooth,", "start": 339, "end": 444}, "d": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for D", "order": 9}, "text": "even prevents certain forms of cancer", "start": 300, "end": 337}}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "The sunflower plant bears bright yellow flowers that always face the sun, hence the name.

{"text": "The vast jungles of the Amazon rainforest are home to tribes mostly isolated from the outside world,whose way of life,largely unchanged for hundreds of years,is now increasingly threatened by modern civilization.\nNow, scientists discover they can monitor these\"uncontacted tribes\"using satellites,which would allow inexpensive and safe tracking of these tribes in order to protect them from outside threats.\nIn order to help conserve these uncontacted Indians,researchers need accurate estimates of their populations.One way to collect this data involves flying over their villages,but such overflights are both expensive and could fill these native peoples with fear.Another strategy involves meeting individuals on the ground,but among other risks,scientists could accidentally spread disease to members of the tribes.\nInstead,scientists investigated whether satellite imaging could monitor uncontacted tribes. The result was inspiring.They confirmed their locations and measured the sizes of their Village,houses and gardens.\"We can find isolated vinages with remote sensing and study them over time.\"Walker told Live Science.\"We can ask:Are they growing?Do they move?\"\nSurprisingly,based on the sizes of the houses and Villages,the scientists find the population densities of these isolated villages are about 10 times greater,on average,than other villages of native Brazilian peoples.This may be due to the fact that they have to live closer together because they are not as good at clearing the forest,since they lack modern devices like chainsaws and tractors,the researchers said.The tribes may also be afraid of spreading out due to fear of being attacked by outsiders,Walker said.\nThe

{"text": "There are two factors which determine an individual's intelligence. The first is the sort of brain he is born with. Human brains differ considerably, some being more capable than others. But no matter how good a brain he has to begin with, an individual will have a low order of intelligence unless he has opportunities to learn. So the second factor is what happens to the individual--the sort of environment in which he is reared  . If an individual is handicapped   environmentally, it is likely that his brain will fail to develop and he will never attain the level of intelligence of which he is capable.\nThe importance of environment in determining an individual's intelligence can be demonstrated by the case history of the identical twins, Peter and Mark X. Being identical, the twins had identical brains at birth, and their growth processes were the same. When the twins were three months old, their parents died, and they were placed in separate foster homes. Peter was reared by parents of low intelligence in an isolated community with poor educational opportunities. Mark was reared in the home of well-to-do parents who had been to college. He was read to as a child, sent to good schools, and given every opportunity to be stimulated intellectually.

{"text": "There has been much discussion recently about reducing the weight of English in China's high-stake tests such as the national college entrance examination. It is argued by some applauding the recent change to reduce the importance of English in tests so that it will lead students to focus more on learning Chinese. The TV program Writing in Chinese has exposed the problem that students and the general public cannot write in Chinese as they used to do.\nSome blame the design of the curriculum for giving English an equal or greater amount of emphasis, which might have contributed to the failure in teaching Chinese. But this is probably not a fair accusation since children in English speaking countries cannot spell either.\nI doubt that studying English in itself hurts the study of Chinese. In fact, high achievers in English or another foreign language are more likely to be high achievers in Chinese. It has been proved many times in recent Chinese history that those capable of using a foreign language are also masters in their mother tongue. Qian Zhongshu, Lu Xun and Lin Yutang are just a few examples.\nAnother trend of thought for curriculum reform is related to the perception of \"worth\". It is true that English is one of the subjects that students do spend too much time on, with pitiful results. This makes some doubt if it is worth giving it priority. But this is not a sound argument either as students still need to study things that matter more to their future in spite of challenges learning English presents to them.\nImprovements in Chinese language education should not be achieved by sacrificing another important subject. There should be a robust  foreign language education program, as a foreign language improves a student's future job prospects. Bashing  English education as a waste of time or using it as a goat for failures in Chinese education are both harmful tendencies.\nTo be constructive, we ought to start a dialogue on ways to make improvements in learning outcomes so that students' time learning English is spent more effectively. There are a few things that could improve English education, such as assessment design,learner motivation and teaching style,\nI am sure there are many other areas where changes can greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of English learning. The public discourse at present is a little oversimplified.

{"text": "There is an English saying that goes, \"he who laughs last, laughs the hardest.\" High School Musical star and teen heartthrob  Zac Efron is laughing a lot these days.\n  As a young boy, Efron was picked on in school because he was always the smallest in his class and teased because he had a big space between his teeth. In the sixth grade, Efron's basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime  , with three seconds left, he rebounded the ball and passed it to the wrong team! They scored and his team lost the game.\n  But history, as they say, is a thing of the past. Now at 21, Efron is one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People, graces the cover of Entertainment Weekly, Hollywood's most influential magazine, and is traveling the world promoting the third High School Musical film. Director Adam Shankman described Efron as \"arguably the biggest teen star in America right now.\" Simply google \"Zac Efron\" and you get more than 14 million responses. Yes, it seems Efron has a lot to smile about these days.\n  Efron was born and raised in California. He took school seriously. According to Efron, \"he would flip out if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a class clown.\" It was his father who encouraged him to act. He took part in school performances and with a local theater group. He also took singing lessons. He graduated from high school in 2006 and was admitted to the University of Southern California to study film. But he deferred --why study movies when you can star in them.\n  Now he has signed on to star in the romantic comedy Seventeen Again and to play in the remake of the hugely popular movie, Footloose. Efron is also earning more than $3 million for his role in High School Musical 3. Not bad for a 21-year-old. But Efron still remembers those bullies.\n   \"You always have to remember that bullies want to bring you down because you have something that they admire,\" Efron said. \"Also, when you get made fun of, when people point out your weaknesses, it's an opportunity for you to rise above.\"\n   Efron has risen all the way to the top of the movie business.

{"text": "This year, some twenty-three hundred teenagers from all over the world will spend about ten months in their US homes. They will attend US schools, meet US teenagers, and form impressions of the real America. At the same time, about thirteen hundred American teenagers will go to other countries to learn new languages and gain a new understanding of the rest of the world. \nHere is a two-way students exchange in action. Fred, nineteen, spent last year in Germany with George's family. In turn, George's son Mike spent a year in Fred's home in America.\nFred knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. School was completely different from what he had expected --- much harder. Students rose respectfully when a teacher entered the room.

{"text": "Throughout the world, clothing has many uses. It is used to provide protection from cold. It is also worn to prevent others from seeing specific parts of one's body. However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status , intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender .\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status.

Some serious thinkers are starting to imagine just that.\nBart: I don't know that present-day electronic chips are, but some sort of chips -- I'd guess maybe plastic. Our three-pound brain is definitely a wonder, perhaps the greatest wonder of natural biology. In this coming century, we'll be re-engineering the brain a piece at a time, first with implants  and finally engineering an complete replacement. There's no question that in the distant future we'll play the music of the mind on instruments different from the current ones. So, yes, chips are our destiny  .\nEdward: In 3000 perhaps the biggest difference from today is that there will be no more men. Females can have female children, without any need for men. In about ten years, we'll find the cocktail that women can take to have female children. There'll be no need for men at all.\nGreg: What is Heaven? Heaven's a place where you can create worlds at will, and the ideal Heaven is where you run the whole thing yourself. The current means of getting to Heaven involve various supernatural systems for which, at this point, there's no scientific evidence. So I think we can reduce Heaven to an engineering project which we're doing.

Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are \"culturally adaptive \". \"We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,\" she said.\nDifferent as they are, Wells believes vampires are \"the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties\". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.\nAccording to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.\n\"In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,\" said Wells. \"The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs.

In the eighteenth century, for example, if a person was caught stealing salt, he could be put in prison and his ears could be cut off.\nIn the Roman Empire, one of the most important roads was the one that carried salt from the salt mines to Rome. Guards were stationed along the route to protect against salt thieves, and they received their pay in salt, thus bringing the English word, salary. Any guard who fell asleep while on duty was thought to be \"not worth his salt\", and as a result he would get a little less salt on his next payday. The expression, \"not worth his salt\", is still used today in English.\nIn the modern world salt has many uses beyond the dining table. It is used in making glass and airplane parts, in the growing of crops, and in the killing of weeds  . It is also used to make water soft, to melt   ice on roads and highways, to make soap, and to fix colors in cloth.\nSalt can be got in various ways besides being taken from mines underground. Salt water from the ocean, salt water lakes or small seas can be used to make salt.

They are therefore called greenhouse gases.\nWhen sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface.

Several operations and speech classes later, when she was seven, we found out that Jenny had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis .\nShe could not put pressure on the heels of her feet, so she walked on tiptoe , and when the pain became unbearable, I carried her. Jenny was fortunate, though, because she did not suffer the deformities , often associated with JRA.\nAll through grade school, and on into high school, Jenny suffered, yet never complained. She took her medicine, and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels, and hold her until the pain eased. But, as soon as she could stand the pain, Jenny, immediately, carried on, as though she were pain-free.\nShe wore a smile on her face, a song on her lips, and a love and acceptance of others. That was simply amazing. She ran, when she could run. She played when she could play, and she danced when she could dance. And, when she could do none of these things, she took her medicine, and she waited until she could.\nJenny, a beautiful girl with warm brown eyes, was never a cheerleader. She never competed in a sport. She joined the band. She won a place in the Govemor's School for the Arts; yet, no one in the Charleston, South Carolina School System knew what to do with Jenny. The perimeters were, simply, not in place to deal with a student, who was both active and disabled. Jenny continued to have one operation after another on her ears, all through school. Her hearing improved to 60%, and she taught herself to read lips.\nAt school she was popular, attending every football game to cheer the team on. She carried her pillow everywhere she went, so that she could reduce the pain when she sat down. Then came her senior year in high school. She liked school activities, especially sports.

Soon after that, Forbes moved to London. He took four different jobs at three companies over the next five years. Forbes wanted a better job and higher pay---he was never quite satisfied.\nWelcome to the world of a job hopper. Forbes's story isn't unusual these days and such frequent movement from one job to the next will become more common. The main reason: the nature of employment is changing. There are a lot more contracts and part-time jobs or flexible employment. That leads to people having a greater number of jobs. What's more, layoffs  and pay freezes , among other things, have pushed people from one job to another. In some cases, a bad worldwide job market has limited opportunities for star employees, promoting them to seek new challenges at other companies.\nHowever, employers often think that if a person jumped from his last employer after a short period, he will likely do the same again --- there is a significant financial risk in hiring someone who leaves in short order.\nWhat's more, moving from company to company frequently doesn't mean workers are climbing the corporate ladder  faster. In 2005, Monika Hamori, a professor at Spain's IE Business School, looked at CEOs at about 55 to see if those who moved around more frequently climbed the ladder faster.\nShe found that executives who stayed with one company became CEOs after 23 years, while executives who changed companies many times became CEOs after 26 years.

{"text": "When I opened my e-mail the other day, a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen. She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother, and a lot of it was about the trouble he had getting the phone company to give him a high-speed Internet connection. It was pretty cool.\nRachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown . The software, which is free, can be downloaded at www.facemail.com.\nFacemail faces are lifelike, and they simulate emotions based on emotions-for example, that you put in your text. Type in; -x, and Rachel blows a kiss.\nLife Fx, the company that develops the Facemail, is sure there are broad business uses. The reason e-business is not popular, the company says, is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch.

{"text": "When people talk about Golden Age in Leadville, Horace Austin Warner Tabor and his second wife, Elizabeth McCourt must be included. Their story is becoming one of the legends of the Old West. H.A.W.Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont in 1855 to settle in Kansas. Perhaps he was attracted by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines.

It's called being homesick.\nHomesick means you're upset, sad, and maybe scared. But don't feel surprised. A lot of people get homesick, even grownups. When you're used to having certain people and things around you, it can be scary when they're gone. When you're dealing with other problems, you will feel homesick, too. Some kids may feel more homesick than usual if their parents are getting divorced or if someone they loved has recently died.\nHere are some ideas to help you feel less homesick.\nBring a little bit of home with you. If you're going away from home, bring your pillow or pictures of the people you'll be apart from and look at them any time you want.\nKeep busy. The more fun stuff you do, the less time you'll have to feel homesick. Try to join in activities wherever you are.\nStay in touch. You can make a plan for when you'll call your mom or dad. You can also email or text message to stay in touch with family and friends. When you do get in touch with someone, make sure to talk about the fun things you're doing!\nTalk to someone where you are. Maybe you can tell a friend that you feel homesick. He or she might have some ideas to help you feel better.", "test": [{"id": "997_0", "num": 3158, "mcq": {"stem": "One feels homesick means he's not   _  .", "choices": ["(A) upset", "(B) sad", "(C) scary", "(D) full"], "key": "D"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "both LLTI", "toi": "3||predicate adjective", "pod": "synonymous", "phr": "2", "items": "1", "req_p": "1", "infer_c": "1 paragraph or compare", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 997, "id": "997_0", "num": 3158, "key": "D", "a_base_s": 504, "a_base_e": 509, "b_base_s": 511, "b_base_e": 514, "c_base_s": 526, "c_base_e": 532, "text_length": 1630}, "bases": {"a": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for A", "order": 6}, "text": "upset", "start": 504, "end": 509}, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "sad", "start": 511, "end": 514}, "c": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for C", "order": 8}, "text": "scared", "start": 526, "end": 532}, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "Homesick means you're upset, sad, and maybe scared.

{"text": "When, after a year of being alone on his island, Robinson Crusoe sees a footprint in the sand, the reader of Robinson Crusoe trembles. Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n     Near the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged  a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality.

It's a large, lovely museum, both fun and educational. Here you can see a large fossil collection of all kinds of dinosaurs, as well as a gift shop. You can walk into the past and then the future, learning about the history and the development of the civilization of dinosaurs that lived 120 million years ago.\nRobin Hill Country Park\nThe park is in the beautiful countryside, and is suitable for children's parties and games. It has five new gardens, and offers great opportunities to see and take pictures of the rare red squirrels.\nThe West of the Wight\nHere we have the Marine Aquarium, the Archaeology Exhibition and the Model Railway. They offer another opportunity to combine fun with learning. This is a great place to see ancient boats crossing the narrow strait between the island and the mainland.\nThe Wight Bus Museum\nThis museum is run completely by unpaid volunteers.

{"text": "Where is that noise coming from? Not sure? Try living with your eyes closed for a few years. \nBlind people are better at locating sounds than people who can see, a new study says, without the benefits of vision the ears seem to work much better. \nPrevious studies have shown that blind people are better than others at reaching out and touching the sources of sounds that are close by. Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. \nTwenty-three blind people participated in the study. All had been sightless for at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had lost their vision before age 11. the rest went blind after age 16. The experiment also included 10 people who could see but were wearing blind-folds. \nIn one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 metres away. When the sound was in front of them or slightly off center in front, both groups performed equally well. \nWhen sounds came from the side or the back, however, the blind group performed much better than the blindfolded group. The participants who had been blind since childhood did slightly better than those who lost their sight later. \nRecognizing the locations of distant sounds can be a matter of life-or-death for blind people, say the researchers. Crossing the street, for instance, is much harder when you can't see the cars coming.\nStill, the researchers were surprised by how well the blind participants did, especially those who went blind after age 16. In another experiment, the scientists also found that parts of the brain that normally deal with visual information became active in locating sound in the people who were blind by age 11. These brain parts didn't show sound-location activity in the other group of blind people or in the sighted people. The scientists now want to learn more about the working of brains of \"late-onset\" blind people.", "test": [{"id": "1003_0", "num": 1557, "mcq": {"stem": "The recent study shows blind people are better at telling   _  .", "choices": ["(A) The sources of loud sounds.", "(B) the locations of distant sounds", "(C) the direction of sharp sounds", "(D) the distance of a sound in front of them"], "key": "B"}, "annotations": {"difficulty": {"tom": "one LLTI, other SM", "toi": "3||assertion", "pod": "based on info\noutside the text", "phr": "3", "items": "1", "req_p": "1+", "infer_c": "1+ paragraphs or contrast", "multip": "Number of responses is specified", "text_id": 1003, "id": "1003_0", "num": 1557, "key": "B", "b_base_s": 94, "b_base_e": 137, "text_length": 1942}, "bases": {"a": null, "b": {"marker": {"name": "Basis for B", "order": 7}, "text": "Blind people are better at locating sounds ", "start": 94, "end": 137}, "c": null, "d": null}, "problems": {"stem": null, "choices": null, "complex": null}, "comments": [], "other_problems": [], "required_paragraphs": {"marker": {"name": "Required paragraphs", "order": 11}, "text": "In one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 metres away.

Let's listen to what she said.\n   While eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table. Though by that time I'd live in France for a few months, I couldn't explain it.\n   After surveying French parents, I realized that they aren't perfect, but they have some parenting secrets that do work. French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait.

Perhaps it might be a great idea for urban school districts to offer free classes to parents on how to help their students at home. Of course this idea is far fetched, after all we do not want to offend the parents. What we will do instead is to spend a fortune on teacher training because if the kids are not doing well it must be the fault of the teacher.

{"text": "With more and more wineries   offering organic varieties to lower their eco-footprint  , it's no surprise that they're looking at the environmental impacts of their packaging as well. The making of conventional glass bottles and the corks   uses large quantities of natural resources and causes a lot of pollution.\nBeyond manufacturing, the transport of wine in glass bottles across the country and around the world also has its environmental effect.

The vacuum   packaging of boxed wine allows it to stay fresh for up to six weeks in the fridge once the seal is broken and the first glass has been poured.\nStill, despite the benefits, boxed wine may still be a tough pill to swallow for many wine experts. \"Even those traditionalists who are coming around to the idea that maybe screw caps   are fine for some wines, would not like the idea of a cellar   full of cardboard boxes,\" says wine writer Lee Asbell. \"It is difficult to imagine how wine service at fine-dining establishments would handle such a change.\" For now, boxed wine is still the field of cheaper brands.

{"text": "With my hands and knees on the floor of the airplane, I was searching for an old lady's missing hearing aid during the flight from Sydney to Los Angeles. It occurred to me that this may not be the most dignified posture for a Buddhist nun .\nI had seen the old lady from the seat in front of me as she walked up and down the passage with a flashlight. I asked a few times what was wrong, but she didn't answer at first --- she couldn't hear me. She was wearing a woolen coat. Judging from her accent, she came from Eastern Europe.\nDo you know what hearing aids cost? Thousands, especially for the new tiny hidden-in-the-ear type she described. It takes a long time for an appointment to make a new one, and many doctor visits to get the thing adjusted right. Therefore, my dignity seemed less important than finding that hearing aid. But how does one find a tiny black object in a shadowy jet cabin ?\nThe lady wasn't even sure where or when she had lost it. At one point, a couple of flight attendants did a random search around the lady's seat; I wasn't impressed. They left suggesting that she search the seat of her previous flight! My flashlight turned up all kinds of small objects, bits of plastic, broken pieces of headphones.\nThe old lady said that she gave up. Yet I couldn't. After we landed, as passengers streamed past us, I insisted that the lady move aside while awaiting her wheelchair.
